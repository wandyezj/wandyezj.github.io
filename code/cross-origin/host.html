<!--

  This page is used to test loading the iframe by a host

  Goal:

    allow a tab on a different origin to be able to consistently connect to another tab on a different origin.

  Diagram:

    tab (on origin) <- broadcast channel -> iframe (on origin) <- message port -> host (on different origin that loads iframe)

  Setup:

    this test page acts as both the `tab` and `host` to test the iframe

    - register listener on origin broadcast channel
    - dynamically create iframe
    - wait to receive port from loaded iframe via post message (important the register must happen before the iframe is loaded)
    - register listener on port

  Test:

    - send message over broadcast channel which should be received by the port
    - send message over port with should be received by broadcast channel
