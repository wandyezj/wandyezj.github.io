## Thoughts

biased view of what makes an anime worth watching

The Art of story telling

Does it do something different? Or is it simply a better iteration?

- positive message

- genera
    - Quest
- character development
- plot
- world
- music

Top of a category?

Tasteful or fan service?

Tell the story and move on

- Art

- gender equality
- hard work

- child friendly

- does it inspire?

What is the experience that the overall anime delivers?

Writers and studios and the rest seem irrelevant, it appears rare that a studio releases multiple excellent anime

Studios are small and tend to release only 1-2 things a year

Much of the quality comes from the source and writing a good novel or story is significantly consuming that writers can rarely output multiple successful versions.
