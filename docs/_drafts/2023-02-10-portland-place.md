# Portland Places

A list of some fun things to do in Portland

## Transportation

Amtrak is a great way to get to Portland. Instead of diving you can chill out on a huge train and enjoy the scenery, it's also nice to get up and walk around or meet new people in the dining car. The one downside of Amtrak is that trains are not perfectly reliable, so be prepared for some inconvenience. It's especially important to avoid longer or less utilized train routes.

## Lodging

Society Hotel
    - Right next to the railway station! Avoid the rooms 401 and 402 on the top floor since they are right below the building air circulation unit on the roof and will wake you up with a loud sound and vibrations early in the morning.
