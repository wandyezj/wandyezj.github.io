# Comfortable Scripts

Social scripts - or expected actions in social situations - help people interact.

When the norms of a script are violated it can be uncomfortable for participants. What is the source of this discomfort?

- frustration? - from unmet expectations.
- disappointment? - that expectations are not met.
- confusion? - unsure what to expect.

It's difficult to pinpoint or put into words what is specifically the cause of discomfort. It usually creeps upon us as a feeling something isn't right more than something we reason through.

The cause of discomfort isn't external, it's internal to ourselves. Our interpretation of events is the cause of our comfort or discomfort.

What does this mean in practice?

This means that we can condition ourselves to make ourselves comfortable in previously unconformable situations.


Example experiment

Change something unusual and show other people, you will be unfomfortable and so will everyone else.

if you are a guy paint your nails and show up to work which 

streach ourselves

How comfortable are we with discomfort? Things that challenge our preconceptions?
