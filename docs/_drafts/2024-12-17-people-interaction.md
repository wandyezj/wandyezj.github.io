Techniques for better interactions and outcomes.


Pause 5-10 seconds before speaking.
Rephrase what other person is saying
Tell me more about x...
Recruit someone to give you feedback or a sign to pause for a moment and debrief - how effective was the communication.
 
Look for specific coach and topic
Listen to other people and how people handle it in specific contexts.
 
Ask: How do you want feedback?
Give assurance that they are safe - assure them you are still friends.
Direct - tell me what you need - crisp clear
 
When you say these words this is what I hear...
Can you expand on what you are saying?
 

write out a response, wait 10 seconds, re-read and then send.
