# Authority, Ownership, and Freedom

Root of philosophy over these questions.

Confusion in any of these

business direction, who to serve what
experience, how to serve
architecture, how to build the service

Pillars work together

technical limitations of the architecture and resources required


Freedom to act, allocate a specific percentage of budget to most important things without having to justify up front or fight for resources (reduce fight for resources, keep that for the big things)

minimize necessary synchronization communication between components.
