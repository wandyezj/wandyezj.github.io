Bainbridge Island bike camping trip

Catch the Ferry

The route to Fay Bainbridge Park from the Ferry: https://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/5521768399/

It's a 7 mile ride with a few hills and some nice views of the water. Fay Bainbridge park seems to be Seattle's unofficial "first bikepacking trip" spot. There's at least one pizza place that delivers here. The biker spots at the park are on the beach not far from the water and it's a nice spot for a group trip.

There's a mini mart halfway to the park where we can get snacks, beer, and firewood. They also have ice cream sandwiches for that mid-ride sugar boost.

On the way back out Sunday morning we'll cut west a bit and bike down Madison Ave to hit Blackbird Bakery for coffee and breakfast. They have the best quiche and cinnamon rolls I've ever had, and other yummy things.
