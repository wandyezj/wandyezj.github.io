# Code Day labs

A guide for mentoring a Code Day Labs project.

Consider this guide a set of scripts to follow for setting expectations.

## Outcomes

Outcomes this guide is designed to achieve.

- Everyone has fun.
- Students learn what it's like to be part of a team building software.
- Students learn technology that interests them.
- Students learn to self manage and communicate their own progress.
- Students learn to ask for help when they need it.
- Mentors learn how to better lead a project.

## Project

### Project Selection

I recommend giving students a small choice of well scoped projects.

Projects should be outlined and well scoped before introducing them to students.

Students tend to lack the ability to accurately assess implementation time.

Projects should be completable with 3 weeks of writing code. You as a professional should be able to complete the project in a week long hackathon.  

Allow students to pick which project they want to complete.

Pick projects that use technologies that you have in depth familiarity with since you will be called on by students to answer questions about these technologies.

### Project Principles

- Sustainable
    - over the long term
    - (no backends)
- Private
    - no storage of user data
    - no collection of user data
- Open Source
    - All code should be publicly available on GitHub
- Unlicense
    - All code should be available for anyone to use without any restriction.

### Potential Projects

- Office Add-In using office.js
- Web Application
- Visual Studio Code Extension
- Command line tools

## First Contact

First contact with students will likely be over email

- Introduce yourself
    - attach an updated resume
    - provide contact information
- Propose first meeting time
- Send link to shared team Doc
    - Ask to fill out contact information
- Send link of how you will run the team
- Send links to project proposals


## First Meeting

The first meeting with everyone.

The mentor should reach out and set up meeting at an agreed upon meeting time.

Agenda Outline

- [Introductions](#introductions)
- [Overview](#overview)
- [Expectations](#expectations)
- [Contacts](#contacts)
- [Meetings](#meetings)
- [Projects](#project)
- [Tasks](#tasks)

Everything discussed in the meeting should be written down so students can refer back to it later.

### Introductions

Introduce yourself first

Have everyone introduce themselves:

Take notes to refer back to later.

- Name (pay attention to pronunciation)
- A bit about yourself
- something you are looking forward to

### Overview

Overall Project Arc, where we are today and where we are going.

By the end of the project...

### Expectations

- Define roles
    - your role
    - students role

- Explain how you are going to run the project
- Expectation that things will be ambiguous at times
- How many hours put forth per day and per week.

### Contacts

Make sure everyone has access to everyone's contact information.

- name
- GitHub Alias
- email
- teams alias
- phone number

### Meetings

- Set up teams meeting, make sure anyone can join without being admitted
    - use the same meeting call for all meetings
    - consistent meeting times and topics
    - Monday meeting
    - Friday meeting
    - set up shared notes for each meeting
- Decide on team meeting times
    - I recommend the morning and have a 1:1 on a different day for each student
- set up team meeting

### Projects

- Overview of different project options

Should have two options with the 3rd option being 'something else' have students propose something.

### Tasks

These are the tasks to be accomplished by the next meeting.

- Send Resumes
    - The mentor should collect and review all team members current resumes to get an understanding of students current skill level.
- Have students select a meeting time hey can work together independently


## Weekly Meetings

### Daily Written Standup

Written document of

- Done
    - what you completed since you last wrote this up
- Open
    - include links to PRs if relevant
- Chat
    - anything to chat about
- TODO
    - list of what you are targeting to work on next


### Individual Chats

Schedule a separate day of the week for each person, and separate from Weekly team meetings.

What happens if people do not show up?

### Monday Standup

- Random Fun Icebreaker Question
- Friendly Chat
- Set Weekly Goals

### Friday Retrospective

- Demos
- Check Weekly Goals
