# Code Day labs

A guide for running a Code Day lab project and for students.

Consider this guide a set of scripts to follow for setting expectations.

## Project Selection

I recommend giving students a small choice of well scoped projects.

Projects should be outlined and well scoped before introducing them to students.

Students tend to lack the ability to accurately assess implementation time.

### Project Principles

- long term sustainable
    - (no backends)
- Unlicense

## First Meeting

1. Outline of agenda
    - introductions
    - expectations
    - contact information
    - meeting times
1. Introduce yourself first
1. go around getting introductions (take notes)

### Introductions

- A bit about yourself
- something you are looking forward to

### Expectations

    - your role
    - students role

- Explain how you are going to run the project

### Contact Information

### Set up meetings

- Set up teams meeting, make sure anyone can join without being admitted
    - use the same meeting call for all meetings
    - consistent meeting times and topics
    - Monday meeting
    - Friday meeting
    - set up shared notes for each meeting
- Decide on team meeting times
    - I recommend the morning and have a 1:1 on a different day for each student
- set up team meeting
