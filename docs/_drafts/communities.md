# Communities


Interesting Idea:

Hilariously, somewhat implies that if you need a code of conduct you aren't an adult.

In practice I'm curious how it turns out? Ar [Reed Colelge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_College) s well known liberal arts university they do something similar and people behave themselves more or less.

> Reed's ethical code is known as "The Honor Principle".

> What this means is that a community governed by an honor principle is a community not of rules and procedures but of virtue. As such, it is a community of unfreedom. There is no protected realm; one can never take refuge in, seek protection from, or hide behind a doctrine of rights. Anything that anyone does is, in principle, subject to evaluation. Was it a virtuous thing to do? Was it consistent with notions of honorableness? Does it contribute to the well-being of the community? Is it the kind of behavior that we value and wish to encourage? In the absence of rights, behavior that we do not wish to value and do not wish to encourage has absolutely no protection.
