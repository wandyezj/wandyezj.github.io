# Data

Aren't individual customer experience stories data? Do we really need to collect data for everything?

How many individual stories does it take something to evolve beyond an anecdote? Similarly, there is a lot of existing research and learning (sometimes published as existing research) do we need to collect data to redo that research?

The point above is there seems to be a common perception of data as telemetry. Data is a much broader concept; I think it's important to include research papers, personal experience, anecdote, and customer feedback as well.
