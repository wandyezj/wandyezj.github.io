# Data

Aren't individual customer experience stories data? Do we really need to collect data for everything?

How many individual stories does it take something to evolve beyond an anecdote? Similarly, there is a lot of existing research and learning (sometimes published as existing research) do we need to collect data to redo that research?

The point above is there seems to be a common perception of data as telemetry. Data is a much broader concept; I think it's important to include research papers, personal experience, anecdote, and customer feedback as well.

We can't collect data for everything. In a trivial example, by the time you collect data, it's a little out of date ... so do you collect again? I think the key is to make judgment calls about what areas you have the least confidence in, and balance that against the impact of that lack of knowledge. Then go collect the things you { know the least about } x { outcome has likely most impact }

Individuals feedback verses numbers. How people feel about something is important data. Need to collect both quantitative and qualitative data.
