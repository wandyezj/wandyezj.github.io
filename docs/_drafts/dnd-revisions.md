# DnD Revisions

How to keep the flavor of DnD while simplifying the game and making it more geared towards story telling over mechanics?

Part of this is retraining players as to how to better interact with each other and the story.


- simplify mechanics
- Remove the math
- focus on story telling

## Revising character creation

Players should tell vignettes about how their character acquired their skills.

## Revising Classes

Skip classes and class progressions. Instead let players narrate vignettes about what their character is working on or how they acquire new skills. Let players know when they have achieved that Instead give out points players can use to advac

## Revising Skill Checks

Have everything be a skill with ratings:

- untrained
- novice
- experienced / 
- professional / competent
- master
- divine

Turn skill checks into story plot devices. Instead of a dice roll, the GM looks at the skill and the circumstance, to assess the probability of success and narrates the outcome. If the GM is too timid to allow failure they can roll a dice with reasonable probability.

If players don't have a skill in a situation they can narrate a reasonable flashback about how they acquired this skill.

## Revising Combat

Combat should be less number crunchy, more epic interactions. Have players describe what their characters are doing. i.e. instead of hitting a goblin for some damage knock them down or out. Since combat is unpredictable the GM might explain how players get injured.

Instead of hitpoints go for durability

- weak
- normal
- tough
- 

## Scratch

I'd like to try something like a DnD flavored game, but with some revisions to core mechanics to focus more on story telling. I like the flavor of DnD, and I think there is a lot of cool source material in the manuals.

I was thinking of a more free-form game like:

Instead of points in skills - have a rating {untrained, novice, competent, master, divine} that can be used for skill checks. Same for basic physical traits like {int, wis, cha, dex, str, con} maybe {none, pathetic, sad, poor, average, good, excellent, ridiculous, divine}

Instead of combat with dice rolls - have players narrate what their characters do and determine the outcome based on their skills and what makes a good story. i.e. your character might be a competent swordsman, but while you run a goblin through another stabs you in the back.

Instead of distinct classes - have players describe what their character is working or award them skills and abilities based on the game. As a GM this lets you have more control over the overall story since characters will have more or less what you want them to have. Similarly, players could have flashbacks to develop their history to explain how they have a skill if the need arises. 

I think the other tricky piece is that when there are too many things on a character sheet it becomes hard to keep track of them all, so limiting the number of things people have to keep track of might make for a more interesting story.

Applying the same thought process to NPCs might make it easier to construct and describe them.
