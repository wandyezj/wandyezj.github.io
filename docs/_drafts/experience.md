Mass production of goods and services allows for more consistent experiences at scale.

The most critical aspect of mass production is the system that designs and implements the experience delivery mechanism.

For example:

A bowl is an experience. What is the entire experience of the person that buys, owns, and uses that bowl?

The design of the bowl needs to consider both the end customer experience along with all other aspects to produce that experience. The production of the bowl is an experience for someone else. The design of the bowl can take into account the experience of manufacturer.

Once that bowl is designed is there a feedback mechanism to refine that design or tailor that design to new experiences? The same bowl may not fit every circumstance.

Innovation is possible throughout the entire product lifecycle to devise a better experience.
