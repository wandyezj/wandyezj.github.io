# Law

Law is a conflict resolution mechanism.

Is the Judge impartial? No, the Judge should be biased toward increasing the legitimacy of the law.

For congress and the president legitimacy is maintained by elections, however federal judges are not elected so what maintains the legitimacy of the legal branch? Legitimacy is maintained by popular opinion to the extent that people believe the law is being upheld and is reasonable and valid so they respect the rulings. Ultimately it is not reasonable for federal judges to be subject to election since they would then be subject to additional popular opinion in their rulings and thus the law would loose legitimacy.
