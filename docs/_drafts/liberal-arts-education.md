# Liberal Arts Education a Viewpoint

Intersection of many fields.

A Liberal Arts education should provide both breath and depth.

Broad education to look more widely, but also depth in a specific employable discipline.

Emphasis on comprehension and communication. Understanding and communicating across cultures and fields.

Goal to be able to define a problem in any field and put together a plan and people to tackle that challenge. Cut across fields to put teams together to solve that challenge.

Encourage a love of learning, fun and rigorous curriculum, excited and curious after college.

Personal projects across all 4 years that takes what is learned in class and applies it to a specific issue the student the passionate about.

Paths:

- business
    - consulting
    - finance
    - program management
    - Graduate School - MBA
- law
    - politics
    - Graduate School - JD
- technical
    - program management
    - Graduate School - MS or PhD


Across 4 years each with two semesters, assuming 4-5-6 classes, thats 32 - 40 - 48 classes.

each semester is about 15 weeks.

Assume 10 hours per day of time for classes and studying, 50 hour week (assume some time spent on the weekend)

Encourage students to seek involvement and new experiences.

What should a liberal arts major know and be able to do?

courses need to be cut down and focused.

Probably need 5 classes

- 4 math classes
    - enough mathematics to understand most things and give the ability to learn the rest independently
    - nearly equivalent math to most STEM peers but without the specialized applications
- 10 science classes
    - enough for sufficient background in most science fields and to have the ability to learn the rest independently.
    - science should emphasize understanding over manual computation
    - More grounded in the breath od science than most peers
- 8 communication classes
    - enough to develop excellent communication skills across multiple mediums
    - one per semester
- 5 history classes
    - broad understanding of the global context
    - would like this to be about 10 equal to science
- some (5) arts classes
    - art is an important expressive skill
- 10 specialization classes

Project class - meant to facilitate students going after their own interests. Heavy faculty and group involvement.

Writing classes should have students writing a short one page paper each week.

## Potential Schedule

Goal about 1 class per day, and to have an array of subjects per semester.

Students should target classes towards their personal projects.

The first two years should be general education requirements

## Course Prerequisites

Generally most classes should be independent not needing other classes before taking them

Psychology -> Design (human factors)
Discrete Math -> Programming -> Computational Data Analysis and Modeling

Basic Writing -> Other Writing Classes

## Specific Class Topics

Maths:

- statistics
- calculus + multi-variable calculus
- linear algebra
- discrete math

History:

History classes are about reading, comprehension, analysis of historical documents, thinking, questioning, communication and writing. History should touch all subjects.

- American
- European
- Classical
- Chinese
- World?
- Specific topics

Science:

Hard Sciences are about teaching what has been discovered and understanding the lingo to understand the basics. Ideally these are taught similarly to that of a history class.

- Biology
- Chemistry
- Physics I (Physical)
- Physics II (E&M)

Soft Sciences are more people focused

- Economics
- Psychology
- Programming
    - websites, GitHub, data retrieval and parsing

- Design
- Study Design

- Computational Data Analysis and Modeling

Communication:

- Reading and Writing together

- Speech
- Drawing
- Video Editing
- Story Telling
- Basic Writing
- Technical Writing
- Persuasive Writing
- Informative Writing
- Creative Writing


Arts:

- Drama
- Literature
- 

Specialization:

- targeted towards a specific field: Politics, Law, Education, Buisness, Manufacturing
- this is intended to be a specific marketable skill.
