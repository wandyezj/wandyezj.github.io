# Matchmaker

The dating experience has room for improvement. Can an app make for a better dating experience and lead to better more health outcomes

Goal og having a good date. What is a good date? Highly subjective up to the people on the date and what they are looking for.

Force peope to make a concious choice about what they are looking for in a date, and to thus set a success criteria. Goal to be to learn on each date what you like and don't like.

There is an abundance of dataing apps but they al follow the smae model. Peopel trying to find each other. Waht if instead of trying to find people for yourself you matched other people.

can have some selection criteria that limits possible matches. Can follow IETF definitions of MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY, MAY NOT

What information would people want in order to be able to match other people?

Dating applications contain a lot of personal information instead of putting in your own characteristics simply apply what you are looking for.


- religion
- sex
- sexual preferences
- culture
- endorsements from friends
- do you want kids?
- do you have kids?
- do you have any mental illnesses?
- do you exercise?
- smoke
- drugs - have to be specific

This way anyone can participate even if they aren't looking for themselves.

Search functionality - this is more expensive to serve.

Your matchmaker value goes lower if people don't agree with you.

two different reactions, yeah you are right, after the date, did it work out.

No one likes decisions, have someone else make the decision for them. No one wants to pull the trigger, so instead make the decision for them.

Rating for if the person went on a date. Active user.

Definite rejection instead of ghosting.

Identity how to confirm the person is a real person?

Government ID? Student ID? Student Email? Bills with established name?

Separate Database that estabishes 'real' from main application. Pull 'real' data offline to disconnected storage where data can only go in and nothing can come out.


Want everyone to have a Psudonym as well so that they are anonymous.

limit images to a single logo that people can display to identify each other.

How would people identify each other in real life if they don't see a photo? ASL? But these are identifiers?

erase conversations, keep local on devices


Maybe a select


Can match people to other things as well

- organizations
- restaurants
- friends
- events

no posts that's silly, messaging individuals only
