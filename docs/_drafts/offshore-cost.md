# Offshore Cost

A common refrain is that offshoring is cheaper. Is it?

When all costs and risks are accounted for does offshoring still make sense?


- Different Legal Landscapes - different compliance requirements
- Geopolitical risks - countries in dispute - tariffs, legal action
- Shipping Disruption - extended supply chains - capital cost of inventory and loans for that inventory.
- Currency changes

- Risk of technology transfer and building your global competitor
- Risk of loosing know how and expanding the gap between production
- Loss of agility in identifying problems and making decisions, cultural differences and misunderstandings, communication slow down across time zones

- Long term does the offshoring make sense? As wages rise does this still work out? Are there long term liabilities from environmental damage?
- Dealing with different cultural workplace expectations.

- Are you at risk for political action, protests, ect.. from countries with different politics.

How to account for the total cost and how to mitigate risks?

It's very difficult to account for all of the costs
