# Open Social Media

Technical challenge, is it possible to build a completely open source social media network?

Is it possible create a network without any centralized authority other than base software development and distribution?

How can servers be eliminated? How can privacy be preserved?

Does the network layer support?

Are IP addresses assigned permanently to devices? Or near permanent? Is the refresh rate low enough for the network to be preserved?

How to have a good enough user experience where it is an adequate substitute for other applications?
