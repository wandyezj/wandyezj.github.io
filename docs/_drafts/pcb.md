# PCB

- [Printed Circuit Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board)
    - traces and pads to connect points together
    - allows signals to route between several physical components

- trace
    - path between pads (typically copper)

- hole
    - hole to insert of solder component


- pad
    - portion of exposed metal on the surface of the board to which a component is soldered

- via
    - hole to connect traces on one layer to a trace on another layer, connects 2 layers of pcb

- jumper
    - wire to place where track can't be drawn

- plane
    - excess copper area

- track
    - coper line connecting 2 parts / wire of circuit

- foot print
    - component print on PCB

- annular ring
    - ring of copper around hole

- legend / silkscreen
    - number, letters, symbols on the circuit board to describe components

- soldermask
    - ensure traces are electrically and physically insulated

- surface finish
    - laye on top of pads to prevent copper oxidation


- gerber file
    - universal way of telling manufacturere ho to make a board

- electronic design automation EDA

- DRC - Design Rule Check


- thou - th
    - unit of measurement for circuit boards
    - 1 thou = 0.001 inch = 0.0254 mm = 0.00254 cm

- [copper pour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_pour)
    - reduces noise
    - ground

PCB types

- single sided
    - traces and pads on one side of the baord
- double sided
    - traces and pads on both sides of the board

- multilayer
    - traces and pads on both sides and traces on layers within the board


- Fritzing
    - open source EDA

- breadboad view
    - build cicruit
- schemantis view
    - circuit diagram of breadboard view
- pcb view
    - export as pcb


- Eagle

- Easy EDA
    - free web based
