# Personal Philosophy

This build off of building your life.

When you look back what are you going to be proud of?

What is a life well lived? This issue with philosophy is it can't give you an answer it only tells you what other people think. But what do you think? What do you believe?

Consequentialism, has limits. However if people knew how things would turn out would they choose differently?

That's the idea of a concious choice. Yet we are always faced with limited information, we simply never have all the information we wish we had. Nor do we spend forever thinkg throught every choice.

So what to do?

What we choose to value changes our actions, since we persue those values.
