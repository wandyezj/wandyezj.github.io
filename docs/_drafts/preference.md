# Preference

Was talking with a friend wh had decided to clerk for a federal judge who was very expereinced was using Word Perfect and that all the clerks were confused and were trying to get hm to use word..

The friend also mentioned that the Judge got to decide what software was used andadopted and that teh IT department just figured it out. One issues was that they couldn't put Wor dPerfect onto a laptop.

Why was teh juge stll using word perfect and why did the clerks suggest Word?
