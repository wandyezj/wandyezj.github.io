# Aspects of Programming Languages

This aims to be a summary of features developed for programming languages:

Programming languages cannot be separated from their development environments or execution engines.

## Evaluating Languages

- Programmer Productivity
- Ease of Learning
- Ease of First Draft
- Ease of Maintainance


Is there a Mathematical language? One suited to writing out equations and solving them? Needs to explain how the problem is solved

## Core Features



## Desireable Properties

Clearly defined and understandable Variable Scope and lifetime.

Ownership of variables

Definition of access of variable names
    - need clearly defined blocks
