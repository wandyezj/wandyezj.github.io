Networks

Access to the network

what about specific IP addresses or ports?

What about specific http endpoints

What about specific requests to http endpoints?

need it pre encryption, but evn then if passing some parameter could be anything underlying the bits

but.. does offer more  confidence about the specific routes connected to and parameters used



strictly enforced memory and processor resource usage to guarantee only so much usage occurs.
