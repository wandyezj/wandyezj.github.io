Live verses Recorded

Recorded gives you more control and allows you to quickly iterate

Live allows you more control over the audiance and is harder to pull off well

Planning

Create assets separately

- Text
- Live recordings
- Images
- Audio Recordings

Presentation

Use a program like clip champ to put these assets together

- Cut out filler words
