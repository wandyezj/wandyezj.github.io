# Python Language Review

- Typing system is crazy - where types are actually instantiated objects. Annotations verses built into the language
- unclear which methods are public and which are private in a class.
- Overwriting methods on an object is normal practice
- importing many features of a languages

- No distinction between generator and an async function in the definition, instead `yield` in a function simply makes it a generator.

## Interesting Keywords

- `assert` is build it as a keyword.

## Non Standard Oddities

- Comment for a method is underneath the name of the method in a string
    - No distinguishing a method doc verses a string.


## Relatively Normal

- `async` `await`
