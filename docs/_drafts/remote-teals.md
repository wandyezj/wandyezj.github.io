# Remote Teals

Vision: engaging the community in education.

- Volunteers companies often match hours
- headsets (ideally noise canceling) and microphones
- video calling and chat environment
    - should support breakout rooms
- Development and assignment environment (example: replit)

- many schools have an intro and more self driven advanced track, sometimes schools don't have enough students for two different classes so they combine them.

- Setting expectations with students
    - self driven
    - point is to learn
    - no grades on assignments, pass fail you made a good attempt
    - final project to show off what you learned
    - exams
    - have video on
    - how should students approach assignments? tactics like read entire assignment before hand (only possible if assignment is relatively short)

- plagiarism
    - sure you can copy the assignments off the internet, but why? There are no grades it's just did you learn.

- student engagement tactics
    - "Good morning! How are you all doing?"
    - "I'd like to see your smiling faces, or frustrated faces"
    - "What are you working on? Anything I can help with?"
    - "pop quiz, lets go to a breakout room"


- assignments
    - need to be written to engage
    - written in platform neutral markdown
    - how long do we expect the assignment to take?
    - what is important to take away?


General
    - avoid comparing students, avoid terms like 'behind' and 'ahead', each student is different and on their own learning journey.
