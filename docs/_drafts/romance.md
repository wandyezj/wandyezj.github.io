# Romance

An important part of building and maintaining a relationship is romance.

To romance your partner it's important to have encounters that delight your partner and you.

Encounters should relax you and your partner and allow you to escape the day to day and focus on each other and your relationship.

Romance allows you to express how well you know your partner to make them feel special and appreciated and create fond memories together.

Romance isn't about any activity it's about focusing on each other and growing and deepening your relationship.

## Gifts

Can a can of sardines be romantic?

I recently bought my partner a can of fancy sardines while we were out shopping for snacks. Most people might think this gift only appropriate for a white elephant exchange, but my partner flashed a grin of deep satisfaction upon receiving it. These sardines told her that I cared about both her physical state (hunger) and her specific food preferences enough to know the perfect gift for this moment.

No article can tell you what to specifically give your partner. You need to pay attention to your partner and know them well enough

Showing you care

The other person can appriciate that you were thinking about them

You thought about it, you knew me, 

It's how the other person interprets it. The explanation -> if your partner looks confused, hesitant. Charm gets taken away if have to explain yourself too much. Why you got it for them should be obvious. Write them a note, hope your hands remain clean as you enjoy this tropical fruit. 

Joe gets annoyed because it deprives him of the joy of shopping, takes up space, and them has to spend time getting rid of it, adn then have to insult them by showing thme you don't have it anymore.

Food is a good gift - there is always a reason it's no longer around.

Depends where you are in your relationship

 Get them something that demonstrates you know what delights them. And remember that in some moments, a tin of dead fish can be sexier than a bouquet of roses.

The thought process that goes into a gift is what inspires romantic feelings. The gift symbolizes how well you know your partner, and that you care about delighting them. In some moments, a tin of dead fish is sexier than a bouquet of roses.

I can't tell you what gift your partner will appreciate, no article can

 and what will delight them, and that you care enough about their 

It is not the gift that counts, but the thought process required to come up with that gift which inspires romantic feelings. In some moments, a tin of dead fish can be sexier than a bouquet of roses.

Similarly my partner knows that I love when she writes me letters, draws me something beautiful, or takes me on an adventure to try something new.



 I know my partner and how much they love new tasty fishies


The thing itself is not romantic, what is romantic is your partner knowing that you thought of them, their needs, and what delights them.

For example a can of sardines can be a romantic gift.
