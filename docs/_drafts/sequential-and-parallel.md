# Sequential and Parallel

What makes parallel programming hard?

People think sequentially, this means that any parallel problem must be transformed to a sequential problem to model and manipulate.

An example of sequential and parallel is present in a musical score.


A musical score with multiple concurrent parts is difficult for most people to imagine the sound of. Even when listing to a performance with multiple concurrent parts we tend to selectively focus on one or two parts at a time or to combine them into a single sequence of sounds.

When listening we blend these notes together into a single piece

Seems to be a fundamental limitation, implications for other kinds of design where we are unable to effectively grapple with alternative approaches because we can't think of them.

Complex branching logic as an example

Music scores, counterpoint and harmony.

Have to be able to describe something as a model that we can mentally manipulate, perhaps better tools.

Event driven as a form of parallelism
