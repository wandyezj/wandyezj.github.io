# So you want to be a programmer?

One of my favorite books growing up was "So You Want To be a Wizard?". Even now the book sits on my shelf.

TODO: Read book to check story out:

In the opening chapter the main character Nita describes themselves reading a series of "So you want to be ..." books describing various professions. Perusing the library once again the main character stumbles across a book titled "So you want to be a wizard?", a wizard she becomes mastering the arcane words, and she proceeds to defeat the arch evil of entropy all in the span of the first book.


The delight of text controlling action. If only you know the magic commands. turning into discrete commands and action.

To be a programmer is to love language and process.



 Like all fantastical stories the main character discovers 

 defeatign the evil entrophy and chaosh and bring order to the cosmos.

Beiing a programmer is as close to wizardry as you can get.
