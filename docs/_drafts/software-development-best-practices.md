# Software development best practices

## Use a Spell checker in the editor

- Use a spell checker and have a list of misspellings
- software contains many unique words, add these to the spellcheck dictionary.
- use consistent vocabulary to avoid having to add too many words to the spell checker.

- provide formatting functions for output to avoid silly mistakes
- include units in variable names
