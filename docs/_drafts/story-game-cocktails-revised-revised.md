## Core

Explore parties social function.
What does it take to put on a party?
Focus on the interpersonal drama - how do people handle it?

"I don't go to many parties, but I want to explore them through the safe lens of fiction."

## Introduction

Cocktails is a game about party drama.

What's the occasion? Who's the host?

Who are the guests? Who's invited? Who's not, and shows up anyway?

Are we kids at a house with the parents away for the weekend?

Are we space alien aristocrats at a peace conference?

What happens when personalities clash?

What will guests walk away with?

In cocktails, we plan our party, invite our guests, and role play the drama.

## Party

### Concept

Decide on a concept for the party together.

Read the following questions aloud. Discuss these questions as a group and write down the answers.

What is our party?

- What's the occasion? See [List of Occasions](#list-of-occasions) of come up with your own?
- What's the setting? Fantasy? Real world? Sci-fi? Medieval?
- Where's the party?
- When is the party?
- How many guests were expected? How many are there?
- What is the vibe?
- Who is the host? What is their name? What are they like?

### Activities

What do guests do at the party? Where do they do it?

Everyone, in any order, describe one activity that takes place at the party and where it takes place.

Example

```text
Guests chat at the charcuterie table while eating tiny pieces of cheese on tiny crackers.
```

### Details

Everyone, in any order add a detail:

- What does the location look like?
- How is the location prepared for the party? Are there decorations? Describe a decoration.
- How do guests find out about the party? Is it a letter, poster, email, text message, word of mouth?
- What do guests smell?
- What food is there?
- Add a detail to something that's already been said.

Do it again.

Example

```text
Faculty were informed of the holiday party by email.
The grape vines of Le Chateau are decorated with lights that are aglow in the night.
```

## Characters

We will brainstorm a list of character ideas, then create major characters, and minor characters.

Major and Minor characters are owned by a single player for the duration of play. The player who owns a character has final say on what happens to their character.

### Ideas

Brainstorm a list of character ideas.

Who might be invited, might show up, or might be at the party?

Create a list of simple character concepts.

Make about three times as many as there are players and write them down.

Example

```text
Tenured Professor
Professor who really want's tenure
Shy Professor
Dean
Theater Professor
Administrator
Professor who's too into dancing
Loud Drunk
Professor retiring this year
Professors Date
Wealthy Donor
Star Student invited to give a speech
```

### Major Characters

Create your major character

Create the character you will play at the party. You may play the host.

Describe their concept, looks, name, age, and pronouns.

- Who are they and why were they invited?
- How do they feel about the party?

When you are done, share your character with everyone else though a brief vignette of your character finding out about the party. How does your character find out about the party? Where are they? 

```text

Character Name (Pronouns) (Player Name)
  - Description
  - Dread - Character Name Right/Above 
  - Hope - Character Name Left/Below

```

#### Bonds

Once everyone has shared their character, create bonds with the characters on your left/below and right/above.

- __Hope Left/Below__ Why does your character _hope_ the character to your left/below is at the party?
- __Dread Right/Above__ Why does your character _dread_ the character to your right/above being at the party?

In any order, give a brief vignette of your character that highlights how your character feels about the characters on their right/above and left.

### Minor Characters

 Create minor characters

Everyone, in any order, add a minor character who might be at the party.

Give them a name and a one line description, and include the owning player.

Example

```text
Character Name (Pronouns) (Player) - description
```

You may add new minor characters as needed.

## Scenes

Play take place in three phases:

1. [Entrances](#entrances)
2. [Encounters](#encounters)
3. [Epilogs](#epilogs)

In the first phase: Entrances - players narrate their main characters entrance to the party.

In the seconds phase: Encounters - player narrate or role play scenes of their character at the party.

In the third phase: Epilogs - players narrate what happens to their character after the party.

At any time during a scene if a player thinks a characters action has consequence they can use ["But only if..."](#but-only-if)


### Entrances

In any order, describe your characters entrance to the party.

- How did they arrive?
- What are they wearing?
- How are they feeling?

### Encounters

Start with the first player, play rounds of encounters.

- Who is there?
- What are the characters doing? (see actions for inspiration)
- Role play the scene.


In subsequent rounds player will set encounters - scenes staring their main character and any other characters.

Exit

During any scene where a player main character is involved, a player may choose to have their main character exit the party.

Rounds of Encounters continue until all but one main character has exited the party. Or when players decide it's the last round.

If your main character has exited the party but other players main characters are still at the party set a scene with your minor character that involves

Dictated Scenes - you may decide to narrate something your character does alone.

The next player is always the player to the left/down of the current player.


### Epilogs

In any order, narrate a final vignette describing their character after the party.


## FAQ

### What happens if my main character has exited the party and my minor character has also left the party?

Create a new minor character if needed.

### But only if

At any time during a scene if players disagree about what should happen:

0. Don't contradict what has already been said.
1. If introducing something big about the party context other players need to agree first.
2. A player has final say over what happens to main characters and minor characters they control.
3. If there are disagreements about what should happen in the game, we use "But only if..."

The main idea of "But only if..." is "Yes, and...". We want to build off of each others ideas.

If a player has a character do something you think should have a consequence, you may propose that consequence. The default assumption is that the other player agrees to the consequence.

If the player doesn't like the consequence, the can get alternatives:

1. The consequence proposing player may propose a single alternative consequence.
2. Another player (who has not yet provided an alternative) may offer an alternative consequence.

The player must pick one of the alternatives.

The player may in turn propose a consequence to the consequence, i.e. yes, and...


### Play Order

Plays takes place in a series of rounds.
Players take one turn each round.
Decide which player is first.
Play order is to the left/down of the first player.

Write down play order.


Example

Assume there are Four players: Ace, Ben, Cal, Dan, and Ace is selected as the first player.

If they are playing in person, and are positioned around the table like so:

```text
    Ace
Dan     Bob
    Cal
```

The play order for each round will be: Ace, Ben, Cal, Dan.

If playing online, and players are listed like so:

```text
Ace
Ben
Cal
Dan
```

The play order for each round will be: Ace, Ben, Cal, Dan


When play takes place in any order, players may decide what order they want to go in. If there is disagreement then default to the play order.



## Reflection

I want players to think about what this party says about the characters - think about the idea of the party in general.
