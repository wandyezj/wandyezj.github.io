## Core

Explore parties social function.
What does it take to put on a party?
Focus on the interpersonal drama - how do people handle it?

"I don't go to many parties, but I want to explore them through the safe lens of fiction."

## Introduction

Cocktails is a game about party drama.

What's the occasion? Who's the host?

Who are the guests? Who's invited? Who's not, and shows up anyway?

Are we kids at a house with the parents away for the weekend?

Are we space alien aristocrats at a peace conference?

What happens when personalities clash?

What will guests walk away with?

In cocktails, we plan our party, invite our guests, and role play the drama.

## Party

Decide on a concept for the party together.

Read the following questions aloud.

Discuss these questions as a group and write down the answers.

### What is our party?

- What's the occasion? See [List of Occasions](#list-of-occasions) of come up with your own?
- Where's the party?
- When is the party?
- How many guests were expected? How many are there?
- What is the vibe?
- Who is the host? What is their name? What are they like?

### Activities

What do guests do at the party? Where do they do it?

Everyone, in any order, describe one activity that takes place at the party and where it takes place.

Example

```text
Guests chat at the charcuterie table while eating tiny pieces of cheese on tiny crackers.
```

### Details

Everyone, in any order add a detail:

- How is the location prepared for the party? Are there decorations? Describe a decoration.
- How do guests find out about the party? Is it a letter, poster, email, text message, word of mouth?
- What do guests smell?
- Add a detail to something that's already been said.

Example

```text
Faculty were informed of the holiday party by email.
The grape vines of Le Chateau are decorated with lights that are aglow in the night.
```

## Characters

We will brainstorm a list of character ideas, then create major characters, and minor characters.

### Brainstorm a list of character ideas

Who might be invited, might show up, or might be at the party?

Create a list of simple character concepts.

Make about three times as many as there are players and write them down.

Example

```text
Tenured Professor
Professor who really want's tenure
Shy Professor
Dean
Theater Professor
Administrator
Professor who's too into dancing
Loud Drunk
Professor retiring this year
Professors Date
Wealthy Donor
Star Student invited to give a speech
```

### Create your major character

Create the character you will play at the party. It's ok to play the host.

Describe their concept, looks, name, age, and pronouns.

When you are done, share your character with everyone else though a brief vignette of your character finding out about the party. How does your character find out about the party? Where are they? How do they feel about the party?

Example

```text

Character Name (Pronouns) (Player Name)
  - Description
  - Dread - Character Name Right/Above 
  - Hope - Character Name Left/Below

```

#### Bonds

Once everyone has shared their character, create bonds with the characters on your left/below and right/above.

- __Hope Left/Below__ Why does your character _hope_ the character to your left/below is at the party?
- __Dread Right/Above__ Why does your character _dread_ the character to your right/above being at the party?

In any order, give a brief vignette of your character that highlights how your character feels about the characters on their right/above and left.

### Create minor characters

Everyone, in any order, add a minor character who might be at the party.

Give them a name and a one line description, and include the owning player.

Example

```text
Character Name (Pronouns) (Player) - description
```

You may add new minor characters as needed.

## Scenes

The party plays out in a series of scenes.
Each player will create one scene each round, and then pass to their left/down.

The first round will be describing how your main characters entrance to the party.
In subsequent rounds each player will set scenes staring their main character.
During a scene where a player main character is involved a player may choose to have their character exit the party.
Rounds continue until all but one players main character has exited.
If your main character has exited the party but other players main characters are still at the party set a scene with your minor character that involves


### But only if

But only if - someone else may offer an alternative have to pick one.

### Entrances

Choose one player to go first.

Describe your characters entrance to the party.

- How did they arrive?
- What are they wearing?
- How are they feeling?

### Encounters

### Epilogs

In any order each player will narrate a final vignette describing their character after the party.


## FAQ

### What happens if my main character has exited the party and my minor character has also left the party?

Create a new minor character if needed.


## Reflection

I want players to think about what this party says about the characters - think about the idea of the party in general.
