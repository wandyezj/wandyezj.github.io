## Core

"I don't go to many parties, but I want to explore them through the safe lens of fiction."

Explore parties social function.
What does it take to put on a party?
Focus on the interpersonal drama - how do people handle it?

## Introduction

Cocktails is a game about party drama.

What's the occasion? Who's the host?

Who are the guests? Who's invited? Who's not, and shows up anyway?

Are we kids at a house with the parents away for the weekend?

Are we space alien aristocrats at a peace conference?

What happens when personalities clash?

What will guests walk away with?

In cocktails, we plan our party, invite our guests, and role play the drama.

## Materials

Cocktails is designed for both online and table top play.

All you need is 3 - 4 people you can communicate with, a shared place to write things down, and a few free hours.

### Online Play

- Video Chat Client (Suggested: Discord)
- Shared Document everyone can write in (Suggested: Google Docs)

### Table Top Play

- Blank Paper (Suggested: 8 1/2 x 11)
- Something to write with (Suggested: Pencil)

## Safety

It's important that everyone feels comfortable playing the game, so we can all have fun.

This game involves making things up and role playing.

It's possible we might unintentional introduce something that makes another player uncomfortable.

We all want to have fun playing the game and we want everyone else to have fun as well.

Because we often don't know what might make people uncomfortable until it's in the game we need a mechanism to preserve the fun.

If someone introduces something that makes you uncomfortable say "Lets 'X' that out" and hold up your arms or fingers in a X shape.

We only need to ask questions about what specifically we should 'X' out. Don't ask questions about why.

Once we know what specifically needs to be 'X'ed out we can work together to adjust the story so everyone can have fun.

Everyone should agree to this ground rule before playing.

## Party

To plan our party we will first decide on a party concept: occasion, setting, and host.

We will then decide on the location, preparation, and invitation.

### Concept

It's important everyone come to a common understanding of the party concept.

Decide on the following together in the following order:

1. [Occasion](#occasion)
2. [Setting](#setting)
3. [Host](#host)

For each step discuss options as a group and decide together.

Write down your answers.

Check in with each player and make sure that the concept is something people want to play.

#### Occasion

What's the occasion? Why are people gathering together? What are the vibes?

Examples

- Birthday Party
- Holiday Party?

For inspiration, see [List of Occasions](#list-of-occasions).

#### Setting

What is our setting?

- Real world
- Sci Fi
- Fantasy
- Medieval

Describe anything relevant to the setting so people have a shared concept of the world where the party takes place.

#### Host

What are they like?

What is their name?

### Details

#### Invitation

Answer the following questions

- How do guests find out about the party?
- Where is the party?

- What kinds of activities are planned at the party?

#### Location

Our party could take place at our parents house, or a space yachts grand ballroom.

Decide on the location together.

Describe the Location.
Everyone, in any order, describe one detail about the location.

### Concept

```


### Activities

Things happen at parties. Events occur

 do things at parties. What are activities or events th

What do guests do at the party? Where do they do it?

Everyone, in any order, describe one activity that takes place at the party and where it takes place.

Example

```text
Guests chat at the charcuterie table while eating tiny pieces of cheese on tiny crackers.
```

### Details

Everyone, in any order add a detail:

- What does the location look like?
- How is the location prepared for the party? Are there decorations? Describe a decoration.
- How do guests find out about the party? Is it a letter, poster, email, text message, word of mouth?
- What do guests smell?
- What food is there?
- Add a detail to something that's already been said.

Do it again.

Example

```text
Faculty were informed of the holiday party by email.
The grape vines of Le Chateau are decorated with lights that are aglow in the night.
```

## Characters

We will brainstorm a list of character ideas, then create major characters, and minor characters.

Major and Minor characters are owned by a single player for the duration of play. The player who owns a character plays that character in scenes and has final say on what happens to that character.

### Ideas

Brainstorm a list of character ideas.

Who might be invited, might show up, or might be at the party?

Create a list of simple character concepts.

Make about three times as many as there are players and write them down.

Example

```text
Tenured Professor
Professor who really want's tenure
Shy Professor
Dean
Theater Professor
Administrator
Professor who's too into dancing
Loud Drunk
Professor retiring this year
Professors Date
Wealthy Donor
Star Student invited to give a speech
```

### Major Characters

Create your major character

Create the character you will play at the party. You may play the host.

Your character will have a relationship with the character to the left and right

Describe their concept, looks, name, age, and pronouns.

- Who are they and why were they invited?
- How do they feel about the party?

When you are done, share your character with everyone else.

```text

Character Name (Pronouns) (Player Name)
  - Description
  - Dread - Character Name Right/Above 
  - Hope - Character Name Left/Below

```

#### Bonds

Once everyone has shared their character, create bonds with the characters on your left/below and right/above.

- __Dread Right/Above__ Why does your character _dread_ the character to your right/above being at the party?
- __Hope Left/Below__ Why does your character _hope_ the character to your left/below is at the party?


Though a brief vignette of your character finding out about the party. How does your character find out about the party? Where are they?

In any order, give a brief vignette of your character that highlights how your character feels about the characters on their right/above and left.



### Minor Characters

 Create minor characters

Everyone, in any order, add a minor character who might be at the party.

Give them a name and a one line description, and include the owning player.

Example

```text
Character Name (Pronouns) (Player) - description
```

You may add new minor characters as needed. Players may own multiple minor characters.
The owning player role plays the character in all scenes.


## Scenes

Play take place in three phases:

1. [Entrances](#entrances)
2. [Encounters](#encounters)
3. [Epilogs](#epilogs)

In the first phase: Entrances - players narrate their main characters entrance to the party.

In the second phase: Encounters - players narrate or role play scenes of their character at the party.

In the third phase: Epilogs - players narrate what happens to their character after the party.

At any time during a scene if a player thinks a characters action has consequence they can use ["But only if..."](#but-only-if)


### Entrances

In any order, describe your characters entrance to the party.

- How did they arrive?
- What are they wearing?
- How are they feeling?

### Encounters

Start with the first player, play rounds of encounters.

In each round every player gets to set one scene.
The next player is always the player to the left/down of the current player.

Rounds of encounters continue until all but one main character has exited the party, or when players decide it's the final round.

Each encounter is a scene set by the player whose turn it is.

Players have two options:

1. Dictate Scene
1. Role Play Scene

#### Exits

During any scene where a player main character is involved, a player may choose to have their main character exit the party.
Describe how the character exits the party. How do they feel?

If your main character has exited the party but other players main characters are still at the party, set a scene with one of your minor characters that involves at least one main character still at the party.

What if I still want to talk to someone who has left? You can't! Just like a ral party - things might not be resolved, prepare to be siappointed.

Might want to ask cool if it leaves?

#### Dictate Scene

In a dictated scene you dictate what happens.

#### Role Play Scene

In a Role Play scene you role play with other players to see what happens.

Role Play scenes have three parts:

1. Setup
2. Action
3. Close

##### Setup

Scenes should star main character of the player whose turn it is.

Before starting a scene answer the following questions:

- Who is there (besides your main character)
- What is happening? What are the characters doing? (see actions for inspiration)
- (optional) What happened previously that led to this scene?
- (optional) What is your main character thinking?

##### Action

Role play the scene.

##### Ending

The player whose turn it is decides when to end the scene. Call "Scene" when you want the scene to end.

It can be helpful for other players to suggest where to end the scene.
Other players can suggest ending the scene by asking "Is that scene?".

### Epilogs

In any order, narrate a final vignette describing your character after the party.


## FAQ

### What happens if my main character has exited the party and my minor character has also left the party?

Create a new minor character if needed.

### But only if

At any time during a scene if players disagree about what should happen:

0. Don't contradict what has already been said.
1. If introducing something big about the party context, other players need to agree first.
2. A player has final say over what happens to main characters and minor characters they control.
3. If there are disagreements about what should happen in the game, we use "But only if..."

The main idea of "But only if..." is "Yes, and...". We want to build off of each others ideas.

If a player has a character do something you think should have a consequence, you may propose that consequence. The default assumption is that the other player agrees to the consequence.

If the player doesn't like the consequence, the can get alternatives:

1. The consequence proposing player may propose a single alternative consequence.
2. Another player (who has not yet provided an alternative) may offer an alternative consequence.

The player must pick one of the alternatives.

The player may in turn propose a consequence to the consequence, i.e. yes, and...


### Play Order

Plays takes place in a series of rounds.
Players take one turn each round.
Decide which player is first.
Play order is to the left/down of the first player.

Write down play order.


Example

Assume there are Four players: Ace, Ben, Cal, Dan, and Ace is selected as the first player.

If they are playing in person, and are positioned around the table like so:

```text
    Ace
Dan     Bob
    Cal
```

The play order for each round will be: Ace, Ben, Cal, Dan.

If playing online, and players are listed like so:

```text
Ace
Ben
Cal
Dan
```

The play order for each round will be: Ace, Ben, Cal, Dan


When play takes place in any order, players may decide what order they want to go in. If there is disagreement then default to the play order.

## Scratch

### Reflection

The point of But Only if is to insert drama.

I want players to think about what this party says about the characters - think about the idea of the party in general.

### Thoughts

Seeds are good test cases for the initial setup.

Setup

I'm still debating about what's needed.

I think the party planning roughly breaks down into the following phases:

1. Occasion, Setting, 
2. Host
3. Location
4. Shared vision of the party background: Time, Activities, Events, Special Guests, Vibes, etc...
    - I think the trick here is to figure out what additional questions

Consequences

I've also been thinking about "But only if..." 
I've been wondering if it's possible to still have good consequences in every case while still having players always control their character?

There seem to be a few different scenarios:

1. Consequence to Action - A player has their character do something 
 - You can say - sure your character does that - and there are consequences...
 - In this case we don't take away the character action (that already happened) - we are just picking a consequence.
2. Specific Result - A player wants some result for their character or some change in the world
 - You can say - sure you can have that result - but only if... your character does this...
 - In this case - the player can pick if they want their character to do something
   
Feeling consequences are an interesting case - because it's still the player's character - so my thought is you could say that the other player's character realizes something - then see how the player has the character react.


Describing the location before the party and then describing how it's prepared for the party.
