## Thoughts

- For questions, do we need agreement or can people pick which questions they want to answer until all main questions are answered?

- Conflict resolution
    - You control what happens to your character
    - but only if

## About

I don't go to many parties, but I want to explore them through the safe lens of fiction.

## Introduction

Cocktails is a game about party drama.

What's the occasion? Who's the host?

Who are the guests?

Who's invited? Who's not, and shows up anyway?

Are we kids at a house with the parents away for the weekend?

Are we space alien aristocrats at a peace conference?

What happens when personalities clash?

What will guests walk away with?

We will plan our party, invite our guests, and cut to the action.

## Party Planning

We will then decide on the location, preparation, and invitation.

## Guests

Create a list of character concepts. People who might be invited, might show up, or might be at the party.

Everyone, in any order, add one character concept of someone who might be at the party. Do it again.

## Create your character

Create the character concept you will play at the party.

Describe their concept, looks, name, age, and pronouns.

When you are done, share your character with everyone else though a brief vignette of your character finding out about the party. How does your character find out about the party? Where are they? How do they feel about the party?

### Bonds

Once everyone has shared their character, create bonds with the characters on your left and right.

In any order, give a brief vignette of your character that highlights how your character feels about the characters on their right and left.

- __Hope Left__ Why does your character _hope_ the character to your left is at the party?
