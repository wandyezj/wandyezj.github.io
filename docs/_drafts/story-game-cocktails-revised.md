## Thoughts

- For questions, do we need agreement or can people pick which questions they want to answer until all main questions are answered?

- Conflict resolution
    - You control what happens to your character
    - but only if

## About

"I don't go to many parties, but I want to explore them through the safe lens of fiction."

## Introduction

Cocktails is a game about party drama.

What's the occasion? Who's the host?

Who are the guests?

Who's invited? Who's not, and shows up anyway?

Are we kids at a house with the parents away for the weekend?

Are we space alien aristocrats at a peace conference?

What happens when personalities clash?

What will guests walk away with?

In cocktails, we plan our party, invite our guests, and cut to the action.

do names after creating characters

### Create your character

Create the character you will play at the party.

It's ok to take the chracters and the host.

Describe their concept, looks, name, age, and pronouns.

When you are done, share your character with everyone else though a brief vignette of your character finding out about the party. How does your character find out about the party? Where are they? How do they feel about the party?

#### Bonds

Once everyone has shared their character, create bonds with the characters on your left and right.

In any order, give a brief vignette of your character that highlights how your character feels about the characters on their right and left.

- __Hope Left__ Why does your character _hope_ the character to your left is at the party?
- __Dread Right__ Why does your character _dread_ the character to your right being at the party?

## Action

The action at the party will take place in rounds. Any player can start. Play then proceeds to the player to your left.

In the first round each player will narrate their character arriving at the party.

### Entrance

Popcorn

On your first turn describe your characters entrance to the party. How did they arrive? What are they wearing? How are they feeling?

### Encounter



On your turn, encounter others at the party.

What's happening? Who's there? Role play the scene. You may include minor characters in the scene and have other players play them. Any player may have their character leave the scene at any time. End the scene when you've gotten what you want out of it.

Reactions: When the scene is over any player may choose to narrate a brief reaction to the scene. Eaves dropping, overheard, Across the room Hot Take

### Exit

You may choose to have your character exit the party as part of a scene or as a reaction. Describe your characters exit. How do they feel?

When only one players character remains at the party cut to the epilog. The last character at the party does not narrate their exit.

### Epilog

In any order each player will narrate a final vignette describing their character after the party.



## Revise

### Outline

Mesh more pieces together, instead have a specific list of questions.

### Character Creation

Concepts

Main Characters

Minor Characters - and what is their relationship with another players main character?

Background Characters - boring

### Scenes

- better description of how to make a scene - your main character must be in the scene, and include any other characters you want.
- Rename reactions to "Close Up" "Cut" "Cut" etc.. a brief moment on camera. The idea is overhearing, observing, the scean, What expression is on your characters face? What are they thinking? How do they feel?
