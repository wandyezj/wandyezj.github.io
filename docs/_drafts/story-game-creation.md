# Story Game Creation

Story game inspiration, what inspired people to make a game?

- Eden - from a quiet year game
- Downfall - from a game of polaris
- Epitaph - inspired by Microscope

Reasons to create a new game

How is the game breaking new ground? What do you want from the game?




- Rules should not encourage meta gaming or wining.
- Avoid anything about players winning or loosing conflicts. This distracts from telling a good story which is the point of story games.


## Shock

I like the exploration of social issues not a lot of games do that directly.

It's really hard to come up with a good shock. What is the alternative?

- Shock is the thing that makes you excited to play and makes the game fun so it's critical to get right.
- Vagary is ironed out with procedure. Yet what procedure would you follow?
- There is a lot of social intuition.
- Some social destination people want to get to. Going for an idea that is actually good. Looking for something everyone is excited about.

The rules are very clunky not as streamlined as other games - too much referring to rules. Use of dice - ick.

Brainstorming phase is hard to codify to figure out. How do you codify 'let's keep trying?'


The shock is fundamentally about world creation.
