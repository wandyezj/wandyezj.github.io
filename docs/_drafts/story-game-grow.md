# Grow Story Game

"The only thing that is constant is change"- Heraclitus

Grow is a game about individuals navigating circumstance.

Will you change the circumstance or will circumstance change you?

How will these circumstances change these individuals? Will these individuals flourish or become jaded?

# notes

Want to introduce characters slowly one at a time.

First scene is super hard since need to create everything from scratch.

Write down the character name and description as you go.

Grow is a game about people confronting challenging situations.

"change is the only constant"
"The only constant is change"

Games should teach you something

Playing games should help you consider ideas

You give the game something and the game gives back

Grow is a game about individuals, they can't always choose their circumstances bu they can choose how they react.

characters/ people / or individuals

Put characters in sticky situatios to find out who the characters are and how they change

"change is the only constant"

Game has Major characters controlled by one player and minor characters controlled by any player


Goal is light setup

Decide on setting

Tell other players their characters name and sex

Players decide their own characters ages

you can pick what is reasonably in your characters control, other plaers must establish the circumstances and play the world

How to make it so it nor frustrating and who has ownership over what pieces?

What you say happens happens.

Each turn one of a few actions

flash forward and flash back are big parts of the game play

- play your own character
- create a location, describe the location, and play in it during a scene
- create a minor character, age name sex, and play them during the scene
- challenge another players character with a scene
- establish a relationship with a scene between a major character and a minor character

I'm curious about answering the questions:  

* What is the minimum set of rules needed to successfully guide players to tell a story together while giving them all equal narrative control? 
* What is the minimum setup required so people can start playing immediately? 
* What is the bare essence of an engrossing story? 
* How can a game teach people with little to no experience to become better story tellers?

Game rules guide people to tell specific types of stories. 

Key mechanisms:
* Setup - getting all players on the same page
* Scenes - directing the action. Should all scenes be from a character's point of view?
* Equal Narrative Control - Polaris: "But only if", Kingdom: "Fight or Fix", Ownership over characters (Kingdom, Fiasco)

Questions:
* Is direction over plot needed or will players characters spontaneously create their own plot by interacting with each other's goals?
* Should games try for more than an engrossing story? Shock: exploring social issues, Kingdom: exploring power dynamics? Should games stories strive to reach a higher truth?
