# Remember Tomorrow Revision

The core idea of Remember Tomorrow is individuals verses groups.

I like the core idea. I'd like simpler rules, a more adaptable setting, and more focus on the narrative element.

## Things I like

- Different story threads
- Players can play differently

## Things I dislike

The dice and stat system is used to handle resolution direction and add randomness into the game. Ths single state keeps track of how powerful players and factions are, and helps prolong players stories. This also makes a real consequence on making a deal with a faction.

However is this needed?

- dice
- stats / number

Keeping track of dice rolls is annoying.

Do consequences need be mechanical or can they be narrative?
Would the "but only if..." mechanic from polaris be more of a consequence?
