# Remember Tomorrow Revision

The core idea of Remember Tomorrow is individuals verses groups.

The idea is that individuals struggle against groups to reach their goal.

I like the core idea. I'd like simpler rules, a more adaptable setting, and more focus on the narrative element.

## Quotes

> These stories are about people, and sometimes machines that become people. They are about personal journeys, where characters seek goals, and the big questions when your stories and goals crash into each other.


> What harm comes from getting what you want? What badness comes from cutting a deal with a Faction? Was your goal worth it?

> What do I hope it will achieve? I hope it delivers thrilling stories about interesting characters. Stories that resonate with us as people, and ones that we couldn’t have predicted.

## Things I like

- Different story threads
- Players can play differently

## Things I dislike

The dice and stat system is used to handle resolution direction and add randomness into the game. Ths single state keeps track of how powerful players and factions are, and helps prolong players stories. This also makes a real consequence on making a deal with a faction.

However is this needed?

- dice
- stats / number

Keeping track of dice rolls is annoying.

However, dice introduce randomness into the game and keep it from being predictable.

Do consequences need be mechanical or can they be narrative?
Would the "but only if..." mechanic from polaris be more of a consequence?

What about a checkbox system for characters. The groups can take away a checkbox. Characters could also start with one checked to speed up the game.

Make a deal could allow a faction to check a box which allows them to damage another player up to that many boxes permanently.
