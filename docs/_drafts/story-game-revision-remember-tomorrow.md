# Remember Tomorrow Revision

The core idea of Remember Tomorrow is individuals verses groups.

The idea is that individuals struggle against groups to reach their goal.

I like the core idea. I'd like simpler rules, a more adaptable setting, and more focus on the narrative element.

## Quotes

> These stories are about people, and sometimes machines that become people. They are about personal journeys, where characters seek goals, and the big questions when your stories and goals crash into each other.


> What harm comes from getting what you want? What badness comes from cutting a deal with a Faction? Was your goal worth it?

> What do I hope it will achieve? I hope it delivers thrilling stories about interesting characters. Stories that resonate with us as people, and ones that we couldn’t have predicted.

## Things I like

- Different story threads
- Players can play differently

## Things I dislike

The dice and stat system is used to handle resolution direction and add randomness into the game. Ths single state keeps track of how powerful players and factions are, and helps prolong players stories. This also makes a real consequence on making a deal with a faction.

However is this needed?

- dice
- stats / number

Keeping track of dice rolls is annoying.

However, dice introduce randomness into the game and keep it from being predictable.

Do consequences need be mechanical or can they be narrative?
Would the "but only if..." mechanic from polaris be more of a consequence?

What about a checkbox system for characters. The groups can take away a checkbox. Characters could also start with one checked to speed up the game.

Make a deal could allow a faction to check a box which allows them to damage another player up to that many boxes permanently.



## Revision

Setting / Somewhere

- Pallet - where is this taking place?
- Character Types
- Faction Types

Could create pre-made settings for different flavors.

Turn options

- Introduce - a Character or a Faction
- Deal - have your character make a deal with a faction
- Attack - use a faction to attack another players character


Introduce a faction

- Also introduce a face someone who represent the faction and can interact with the character.


Narrate the other persons success or failure.

Character have story goals

- Ready
- Willing
- Able


1st player must introduce a character, the 2nd player must introduce a faction. Is this a necessary rule though?

Can only own one PC at a time.


## Motivation Table

Both Characters and Groups have motivations

- 1 Envy
- 2 Freedom
- 3 Knowledge
- 4 Lust
- 5 Power
- 6 Pride
- 7 Respect
- 8 Revenge
- 9 Greed
- 10 Survival

## Factions

## Story Goals

For characters:
"Goals are not instantly achievable, but they’re not impossible to achieve either"

[Reddit Hacking Remember Tomorrow](https://www.reddit.com/r/gmless/comments/15xn8dk/hacking_remember_tomorrow/)

These are the rules hacks for Remember Tomorrow I mentioned in the other thread. Most of them we've been using since we played it a bunch at Story Games Seattle years ago. My goal was always to make it easier for people to learn and play, focus more on story than tricky math, while staying true to the core "story tapestry" concept that makes the game so cool. Everything is streamlined, nothing is really added.

If you haven't read or played Remember Tomorrow, these notes will almost definitely make no sense. I'm not explaining the entire game, just covering changes. Caveat ludens.

START OF GAME

Instead of all making characters and then all making factions, half the players introduce characters, then the other half introduce factions, then vice versa. (not really essential but I like it because it lets us see how factions work too before we make the second half of characters)

READY / WILLING / ABLE

Instead of manually distributing points, characters start with 3/4/5 for Ready/Willing/Able in whatever order they like (this removes the problem of overthinking number allocation and also not know how big shifts like starting with very low or high numbers are going to affect play later. No making tactical decisions in ignorance)

No individual stat (R-W-A or Influence) can go up more than 1 in any scene, including intro scenes. But there is no limit on how much a stat can be lowered in a conflict.

7 is the max for any stat

pcons and ncons (postive and negative conditions) are dropped entirely. Anything they would cover is expressed as a change to your Ready/Willing/Able instead ("If you lose this conflict you'll be panicked so your Able will drop by 1" etc). The R-W-A system is very graceful and conditions just add unnecessary complexity. Alllll the conflict stuff you can do with pcons / ncons: gone. 

 STORY GOALS

You never remove story goal checks (that just makes things go on forever)

Going for your last story goal check is the make it or break it moment. If you go for your third check and fail, it's a disaster and that character's story is over. They lose and are written out. This creates much more dramatic character stories. It's a simple change but it's actually pretty huge.

FACTIONS

Influence starts at 3 4, max 7 (but often immediately go to 4 5 in their intro scenes).

Factions do not get written out for having high Influence (the last thing we need is a key antagonist suddenly just leaving the game)

If there are not 2 living named NPCs in the faction you must introduce one when you have them in a scene (keeps the Factions interesting instead of being faceless mobs)

Making A Deal: when a faction is at 7, instead of raising Influence, your deal must hurt another character. You sell them out. You have to name the character and describe how you hurt them. Reduce one of their R-W-A

Another thing that improved our game was bringing in more role-play during scenes instead of rushing to the roll. We'll role-play Deal scenes or bring in other players to be Faction NPCs during a Face-off, etc. Faction NPCs have zero rules protection so they can get killed off anytime, but they add a lot to bring Factions and the world to life.

CONFLICT MATH

These aren't actually changes, but the conflict math can be a little hard to wrap your brain around, so I refer to this cheat sheet. Each side rolls and gets 0-3 successes:

- neither side rolls any successes = both losers
- tied successes = both sides win their goal
- 1 success more than opponent = you win goal, they lose
- 2 successes more than opponent = you win goal + 1 bonus, they lose
- 3 successes more than opponent = you win goal + 2 bonuses, they lose
