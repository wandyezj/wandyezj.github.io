# Shock Revision

For three players.

Pick 3 social issues secretly. Then reveal.

Brainstorm the shock. Ths shock is a single thing in the world that is different. The shock should tie all three issues together and make the game interesting and fun to play. All three players need to be excited to play the game.

Minuta - specifics about the shock.

Three separate stories at the same time. The protagonists will never meet.

Players should pick an issue to be the protagonist for that is not their issue.

Each person decides facts about the issue they own.

One person plays the protagonist and the person to their left is the antagonist.

The antagonist should control the issue that the player is about.

Building characters

Story Goal for the protagonist. The story goal should be something big that relates to the issue they are the protagonist for.
3rd conflict is does the protagonist succeed at their story goal?



Each scene has an orthogonal conflict.
Setting goals is a key part of the conflict.

- Protagonist Goal - What outcome does the protagonist want to achieve?
- Antagonist Goal - What outcome does the antagonist want?

Resolving conflict.
Protagonist 3 dice
Antagonist 4 dice

Each player splits dice between supporting their goal D10 and blocking their opponents goal D4.
Roll all dice take the biggest one.
Subtract the D4 from your opponents D10.

The audiance rolls 2d4 and takes the highest and adds to whatever outcome.

4 is a tie fulcrum which escalates the conflict.
5+ is a success achieve the outcome
3- is a failure

Since players split dice there is immediate feedback about if the other player is interested in your outcome. Good conflicts have the player put more dice to block the outcome.


Paraxis - how do people do things in the world.
Two sets of opposites these exist to import

Explain which ways of doing things your character prefers.
