## Design Goals

- Give the experience of being a wallflower.
- Play with perspective.
- Reflect on how observation reveals the observer.
- Quick setup.

## Introduction

We are playing wallflowers at a large college party.

Wallflowers is a journey of self discovery. We reveal ourselves through our observations and impressions of others.

Who is your wallflower? Why are they here?

Wallflowers don't interact with other guests at the party or with each other. Gameplay takes place solely though the wallflowers: observations, impressions, thoughts, and memories. Critically, wallflowers never participate in scenes, they only observe, even in their memories.

How does it end? At some point you give up being a wallflower and join or leave the party.

Generally, the party is chill, nothing dramatic or bad happens during the party itself - that's not what this is about.

The narrative is non-linear - this means observations aren't necessarily done in order. Players only play wallflowers.

## Setup

Write down the following sections

```text
# Wallflowers

# Stereotypes

# Characters

# Scenes

# Turns
```

1. __Turn order__ Decide on player turn order. Write down each players name in the wallflowers section. Turn order will be from first to last, then loop around.  

    ```text
    # Wallflowers

    - Ace
    - Ben
    - Cal
    - Dan

    ```

2. __Aliases__ Give your wallflower an alias named after a flower. We will use this alias to refer to the wallflowers observations. Each player should pick out their own alias. Each flower alias should be a single word, and start with a different letter. Write down the aliases next to each player in the wallflowers section.

    ```text
    # Wallflowers

    - Azalea (Ace)
    - Begonia (Ben)
    - Camellia (Cal)
    - Dahlia (Dan)

    ```

3. __Characters__ Write down each wallflower under characters.

## Play

The game takes place in a series of rounds. Players take turns in order.

### On Your Turn

On your turn you may do one of the following:

- __Stereotype__ Your wallflower sees a stereotype at the party. Have your wallflower observe an individual or a group. Names this stereotype. What does your wallflower think of them? Write down this stereotype under stereotypes.
- __Recognize__ Your wallflower sees someone at the party they recognize who - in their mind - fits into a previously named stereotype. Give this character a name. What does your wallflower think of this person?  Write them down under characters and which wallflower observed them.
- __Scenes__ Set up a scene that happens at the party other players will play out and describe your wallflowers thoughts. Who is there (you may only use existing character concepts or named characters)? What is the situation? Have other players play out the scene. You decide when the scene ends, i.e. your wallflower stops observing. You may pause the scene at any time to give what your wallflower is thinking. Write down the scene under scenes. Give the scene a short name and description.
- __Extend Scene__ Describe your wallflowers thoughts on an existing scene.
- __Flashback__ The same as a scene but this may take place before the party.
- __Bloom__ Name your wallflower and describe how they join or leave the party. Why did they stop being a wallflower? This wallflower may no longer be played. Write down the name next to your wallflower. You m
- __Switch__ Either, pick up an existing unowned wallflower, or create a new wallflower alias. If you currently own a wallflower, mark them unowned, another player may pick up that wallflower.


### Ending the Game

The games ends when three wallflowers have bloomed or players decide to have a final round.

### Conflict Resolution

At any time, if you disagree about something of think there should be a consequence you can say ["But only if..."](#but-only-if)

## But only if

At any time if players disagree about what should happen:

0. Don't contradict what has already been said.
1. If introducing something big about the party context, other players need to agree first.
2. A player has final say over what happens to the wallflower they currently own.
3. If there are disagreements about what should happen in the game, we use "But only if..."

The main idea of "But only if..." is "Yes, and...". We want to build off of each others ideas.

If a player introduces something you think should have a consequence, you may propose that consequence. The default assumption is the other player agrees to the consequence.

If the player doesn't like the consequence, they can get alternatives:

1. The consequence proposing player may propose a single alternative consequence.
2. Another player (who has not yet provided an alternative) may offer an alternative consequence.

The player must pick one of the alternatives. Or they can take back what lead to the consequence - in which case neither what was introduces or the consequence happens.

note: Players may in turn propose a consequence to the consequence, i.e. yes, and...

## FAQ

### Can wallflowers observe each other?

No. Wallflowers are isolated and don't notice each other.

Reason: This would contradict the design goal of the wallflowers observations revealing themselves.

### Can we play with other party contexts?

Yes. However you will need to discuss and agree on that shared context first.
