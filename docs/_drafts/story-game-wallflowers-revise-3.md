## Design Goals

- Quick setup.
- Give the experience of being a wallflower.
- Play with perspective.
- Reflect on how observation reveals the observer.

## Introduction

We are playing wallflowers at a large college party.

Wallflowers is a journey of self discovery. We reveal ourselves through our observations and impressions of others.

Who is your wallflower? Why are they here?

Wallflowers don't interact with other guests at the party or with each other. The game is about the wallflowers: observations, impressions, thoughts, and memories. Critically, wallflowers never participate in scenes, they only observe.

How does it end? At some point your wallflower joins or leaves the party.

## Setup

Write down the following sections

```text
# Wallflowers

# Stereotypes

# Characters

# Scenes

# Turns
```

1. __Turn order__ Decide on player turn order. Write down each players name in the wallflowers section. Turn order will be from first to last, then loop around.  

    ```text
    # Wallflowers

    - Ace
    - Ben
    - Cal
    - Dan

    ```

2. __Aliases__ Give your wallflower an alias named after a flower. We will use this alias to refer to the wallflowers observations. Each player should pick out their own alias. Each flower alias should be a single word, and start with a different letter. Write down the aliases next to each player in the wallflowers section.

    ```text
    # Wallflowers

    - Azalea (Ace)
    - Begonia (Ben)
    - Camellia (Cal)
    - Dahlia (Dan)

    ```

## Play

The game takes place in a series of rounds. Players take turns in order.

### On Your Turn

On your turn you may do one of the following:

- [__Stereotype__](#stereotype) - your wallflower stereotypes a group.
- [__Recognize__](#recognize) - you wallflower recognizes someone.
- [__Scene__](#scene) - create a scene for another wallflower to observe.
- [__Bloom__](#bloom) - your wallflower joins or leaves the party.

#### Stereotype

Your wallflower sees a stereotype at the party. Have your wallflower observe an individual or a group. Name this stereotype. What does your wallflower think of them? Write down this stereotype under stereotypes along with the wallflowers impression.

#### Recognize

Your wallflower sees someone at the party they recognize who - in their mind - fits into a previously named stereotype. Give this character a name. What does your wallflower think of this person?  Write them down under characters and which wallflower observed them along with the wallflowers impression.

#### Scene

Create a scene with another player for a wallflower to observe.

1. Roles
    - Choose a observing wallflower.
    - Choose a co-creator - another player to create the scene with.
2. Characters
    - First, the co-creator picks a character or stereotype to be part of the scene.
    - Second, choose another character or stereotype to be part of the scene.
3. Backdrop
    - Describe the background activity that is occurring as the backdrop to this scene and where the characters are.
4. Action
    - Describe what the wallflower would reasonably see, hear, etc.. Don't describe anything the wallflower can't observe. For example: the wallflower can't observe what the characters or stereotypes are thinking or feeling.
    - During the scene the wallflower should share their impression about what they observe.
    - First, the co-creator describes the action their character or stereotype is taking
    - Second, describe how your character of stereotype reacts.
    - You may go back and forth a few times to narrate further action.
    - Look away - the wallflower may choose to stop observing at any time to end the scene.
5. Write down the scene under scenes. Give the scene a short name and description.

Example

```text
The game has the following state.

There are four players: Ace, Ben, Cal, Dan

# Wallflowers

- Azalea (Ace)
- Begonia (Ben)
- Camellia (Cal)
- Dahlia (Dan)

# Stereotypes

- Alpha Xi Bros
- Cheer Squad

# Characters

- Kirk - cheer squad - the base of the triangle

It's Ace's turn. 

Ace: I'm going to create a scene with Ben for Cal's wallflower Camellia to observe.
Ben: I'm going to pick the stereotype of Alpha Xi Bros.
Ace: Well, I'll pick Kirk.
Ace: The backdrop is a frisbee game outside.
Ben: Three Alpha Xi Bros are tossing the frisbee between themselves in a triangle.
Ace: Kirk jumps into one of the passes and intercepts the frisbee.
Cal: Camellia thinks, "I guess that guy really wanted to play, but what a jerk to interrupt"
Ben: The bros laugh and widen their circle to make room for the new guy.
Cal: Camellia looks away thinking "Ugh Bros, I'll never understand them"


```



#### Bloom

Name your wallflower and describe how they join or leave the party. Why did they stop being a wallflower? This wallflower may no longer be played. Write down the name next to your wallflower.

### Ending the Game

The games ends when all wallflowers have bloomed or players decide to have a final round.

### Conflict Resolution

0. Don't contradict what has already been said.
1. If introducing something about the party context, other players need to agree.
2. A player has final say over what happens to the wallflower they currently own.
3. Ask questions: What is the intent? How would it work?
4. Add to what has been said. "Yes, and...". We want to build off others ideas.

### FAQ

#### Can we play with other party contexts?

Yes. However you will need to discuss and agree on that shared context first.

#### Can wallflowers observe each other?

No. Wallflowers are isolated and don't notice each other.

Reason: This would contradict the design goal of the wallflowers observations revealing themselves.
