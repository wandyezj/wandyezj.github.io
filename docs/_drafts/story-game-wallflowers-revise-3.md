## Design Goals

- Quick setup.
- Give the experience of being a wallflower.
- Play with perspective.
- Reflect on how observation reveals the observer.

## Introduction

We are playing wallflowers at a large college party.

Wallflowers is a journey of self discovery. We reveal ourselves through our observations and impressions of others.

Who is your wallflower? Why are they here?

Wallflowers don't interact with other guests at the party or with each other. The game is about the wallflowers: observations, impressions, thoughts, and memories. Critically, wallflowers never participate in scenes, they only observe.

How does it end? At some point your wallflower joins or leaves the party.

## Setup

Write down the following sections

```text
# Wallflowers

# Stereotypes

# Characters

# Scenes

# Turns
```

1. __Turn order__ Decide on player turn order. Write down each players name in the wallflowers section. Turn order will be from first to last, then loop around.  

    ```text
    # Wallflowers

    - Ace
    - Ben
    - Cal
    - Dan

    ```

2. __Aliases__ Give your wallflower an alias named after a flower. We will use this alias to refer to the wallflowers observations. Each player should pick out their own alias. Each flower alias should be a single word, and start with a different letter. Write down the aliases next to each player in the wallflowers section.

    ```text
    # Wallflowers

    - Azalea (Ace)
    - Begonia (Ben)
    - Camellia (Cal)
    - Dahlia (Dan)

    ```

## Play

The game takes place in a series of rounds. Players take turns in order.

### On Your Turn

On your turn you may do one of the following:

- [__Stereotype__](#stereotype) - your wallflower stereotypes a group.
- [__Recognize__](#recognize) - you wallflower recognizes someone.
- [__Scene__](#scene) - create a scene for another wallflower to observe.
- [__Bloom__](#bloom) - your wallflower joins or leaves the party.

#### Stereotype

Your wallflower sees a stereotype at the party. Have your wallflower observe an individual or a group. Name this stereotype. What does your wallflower think of them? Write down this stereotype under stereotypes along with the wallflowers impression.

#### Recognize

Your wallflower sees someone at the party they recognize who - in their mind - fits into a previously named stereotype. Give this character a name. What does your wallflower think of this person?  Write them down under characters and which wallflower observed them along with the wallflowers impression.

#### Scene

Direct a scene for a wallflower to observe.

You will set the scene, another player will narrate the action, and another player will describe their wallflowers reaction.

1. Choose an observing wallflower. Pick a player whose wallflowers will observe the scene.
2. Set the scene:
    - Who is there (you may only use existing character concepts or named characters)?
    - What is the situation?
3. Choose a narrator. Pick a player to describe the outcome of the scene. They should be different player than the one controlling the observing wallflower.
4. Wallflower impressions. What does the observing wallflowers reaction? Other players who did not direct or narrate may have their wallflowers observe as well.
5. Write down the scene under scenes. Give the scene a short name and description.

#### Bloom

Name your wallflower and describe how they join or leave the party. Why did they stop being a wallflower? This wallflower may no longer be played. Write down the name next to your wallflower.

### Ending the Game

The games ends when all wallflowers have bloomed or players decide to have a final round.

### Conflict Resolution

0. Don't contradict what has already been said.
1. If introducing something about the party context, other players need to agree.
2. A player has final say over what happens to the wallflower they currently own.
3. Ask questions: What is the intent? How would it work?
4. Add to what has been said. "Yes, and...". We want to build off others ideas.

### FAQ

#### Can we play with other party contexts?

Yes. However you will need to discuss and agree on that shared context first.

#### Can wallflowers observe each other?

No. Wallflowers are isolated and don't notice each other.

Reason: This would contradict the design goal of the wallflowers observations revealing themselves.
