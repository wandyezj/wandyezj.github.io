## Design Goals

- Quick setup.
- Give the experience of being a wallflower.
- Play with perspective.
- Reflect on how observation reveals the observer.

## Introduction

__Read the following aloud to everyone__

We are playing wallflowers at a large college party.

Our game is about our wallflowers feelings and thoughts as they observe alone from the sidelines.

We reveal our wallflowers through their observations and impressions of others. In turn those impressions help our wallflowers discover themselves.

Who is your wallflower? Why are they here?

We find out when your wallflower blooms - joining or leaving the party.

## Play

### Overview

We will each play one wallflower at a large college party.

The game takes place in a series of rounds. Players take turns in order. see [On your turn](#on-your-turn).

The games ends when all wallflowers bloom or players decide to have a final round.

### Setup

0. __Sections__ Write down the following sections:

    ```text
    # Wallflowers

    # Characters

    # Turns
    ```

1. __Turn order__ Decide on player turn order. Write down each players name in the wallflowers section. Turn order will be from first to last, then loop around.  

    ```text
    # Wallflowers

    - Ace
    - Ben
    - Cal
    - Dan
    ```

2. __Aliases__ Give each wallflower an alias named after a flower. Each player should pick their own alias. See [Flower List](#flower-list).

    Each flower alias should be a single word, and start with a different letter. Write down the aliases next to each player in the wallflowers section.

    ```text
    # Wallflowers

    - Azalea (Ace)
    - Begonia (Ben)
    - Camellia (Cal)
    - Dahlia (Dan)

    ```

3. __Stop__ We're done with setup! We don't know anything else about the wallflowers. We will discover everything about our wallflowers through play.


### On Your Turn

On your turn you may do one of the following actions:

- [__Glance__](#glance) - your wallower sees someone they don't know.
- [__Recognize__](#recognize) - your wallflower sees someone they know.
- [__Scene__](#scene) - create a scene for another players wallflower to observe.
- [__Bloom__](#bloom) - your wallflower joins or leaves the party.

#### Glance

Your wallflower glimpses someone at the party they don't know.

0. What is your wallflowers gut reaction to this person? Pick a feeling from the [wheel](#feeling-wheel) or [list](#feeling-list). You may add additional feelings.
1. What does this person look like? What are they wearing?
2. Give this person a moniker. Example "Redhead with glasses"
3. Write this person under characters and which wallflower observed them along with the wallflowers impression.

note: multiple wallflowers may glance at the same character.

#### Recognize

Your wallflower sees someone at the party they recognize.

0. What is your wallflowers gut reaction to this person? Pick a feeling from the [wheel](#feeling-wheel) or [list](#feeling-list). You may add additional feelings.
1. What is this persons name?
2. Where does your wallflower know them from?
3. What does this person look like? What are they wearing?
4. Write this character under characters along with which wallflower observed them and the wallflowers impression.

Example

```text
(Fear and Guilt) Oh Shit! It's Brad from Chemistry class, he's so nice. He let me borrow his text book, and I haven't given it back.
```

note: multiple wallflowers may recognize a character.

#### Scene

Create a scene for one or more wallflowers to observe.

1. Observers
    - Choose one or more observing wallflowers. (You must pick another players wallflower)
2. Actors
    - Who is there? Pick only from already described characters.
3. Backdrop
    - Describe the background activity to this scene and where the characters are.
4. Action
    - Action is done as a silent film.
    - Describe the action in terms of what the wallflower would observe. What are the characters doing? Don't describe anything the wallflower can't observe. For example: the wallflower can't observe what the characters are thinking or feeling.
5. Impression
    - For each player observing:
        - What is your wallflowers gut reaction to this scene? Pick a feeling from the [wheel](#feeling-wheel) or [list](#feeling-list)

#### Bloom

Describe your wallflower joining or leaving the party. Why did they stop being a wallflower?

0. What is your wallflowers feeling? Pick a feeling from the [wheel](#feeling-wheel) or [list](#feeling-list)
1. Narrate a short vignette of your wallflower joining or leaving the party.
2. If your wallflower joined the party name your wallflower and write them down under characters.

This wallflower may no longer be played. You may only play scenes on your turn going forward.


### Conflict Resolution

0. Don't contradict what has already been said.
1. If introducing something about the party context, other players need to agree.
2. Ask questions: What is the intent? How would it work?
3. Add to what has been said. "Yes, and...". We want to build off others ideas.

### FAQ

#### Can we play with other party contexts?

Yes. However you will need to discuss and agree on that shared context first.

#### Can wallflowers observe each other?

No. Wallflowers are isolated and don't notice each other.

Reason: This would contradict the design goal of the wallflowers observations revealing themselves.
