## Overview

We will each play one wallflower at a large high school party in the present day.

The game takes place in a series of six rounds. Players take turns in order. see [On your turn](#on-your-turn).

After five rounds of observations and impressions, the game ends with a final round where all wallflowers bloom.

## Setup

0. __Sections__ Write down the following sections:

    ```text
    # Wallflowers

    # Party

    # Turns
    ```

1. __Turn order__ Decide on player turn order. Write down each players name in the wallflowers section. Turn order will be from first to last, then loop around.  

    ```text
    # Wallflowers

    - Ace
    - Ben
    - Cal
    - Dan
    ```

2. __Aliases__ Give each wallflower an alias named after a flower. Each player should pick their own alias. See [Flower List](#flower-list).

    Each flower alias should be a single word, and start with a different letter. Write down the aliases next to each player in the wallflowers section.

    ```text
    # Wallflowers

    - Azalea (Ace)
    - Begonia (Ben)
    - Camellia (Cal)
    - Dahlia (Dan)

    ```

3. __Stop__ We're done with setup! We don't know anything else about the wallflowers. We will discover everything about our wallflowers through play.


## Introduction

Read the following aloud to everyone:

> We are playing wallflowers - in high school - at a large house party.
>
> Our game is about our wallflowers observations, feelings, and thoughts as they observe alone from the sidelines.
>
> Who is your wallflower? Why are they here?
>
> We find out when your wallflower blooms - joining or leaving the party.


## On Your Turn

If you are the first player, announce each round `Round X`, When it is the fifth round add `Next round we bloom`.

In the first five rounds a turn consist of two parts:

1. [__Observation__](#observation) Describe something at the party the wallflower above you observes.
2. [__Impression__](#impression) The wallflower describes their impression.

In the final sixth round we close the game by having our wallflowers [Bloom](#bloom).


### Observation

Describe something at the party the wallflower notices.

- Object
- People
- Scene
- Detail

Only describe what a wallflower sees, hears, or might reasonably know.
Do NOT describe what the wallflower thinks or feels. Do NOT use any judgement words.

#### Object

Describe a thing at the party the wallflower notices.

This could be a room, furniture, food, sound, smell.

> The heavy oak front door opens briefly to let even more people in, then slams shut letting in a brief blast of freezing winter air.

> There is a huge white couch with massive cushions.

#### People

Describe a person or group at the party the wallflower notices.

Does the wallflower recognize this person? From where?

What does this person look like?

What are they doing?

> A big guy with a scowl on his face shoves past you growling "Watch it". He reeks BO, and his slick sweat smears across your arms.

> Matt from Math class walks by with a huge smile on his face, he's wearing his usual baseball cap with the High School Griffin mascot, a T-Shirt with that says "Rock Punks" in gigantic pink letters, along with his usual shorts paired with socks and sandals, showing off his incredibly smooth legs.

> A group of girls from the cheer squad dressed in matching hoodies and sweat pants are in a circle in the corner laughing so loudly you can hear it across the room.

#### Scene

Describe a scene at the party the wallflower notices.

> A group of guys from the football team, squashed together on the while couch are staring at the TV, and suddenly jump up cheering, a bowl of popcorn tumbles onto the floor flinging popcorn everywhere.

> A girl tightly griping a boys hand drags him to the front door. Her brows are furrowed she looks really annoyed.


#### Detail

You may add a detail the wallflower notices to something that has already been described.

> The huge white couch has a wet stain on the right arm.


### Impression

Once something has been described the wallflower gives their impression.

On your turn guide the wallflower through their impression.

> So [player name], what is [wallflower names] impression?

Have the wallflower recite the following and fill in each part between brackets `[]`

> I am [wallflower name].
>
> I am a wallflower.
>
> Alone...
>
> I see... [see]

- See
    - Describe your wallflowers observation. Summarize what was described. Do NOT add anything new.

> I think... [think]

- Think
    - What does your wallflower think about this?
    - What thoughts go though your wallflowers head?

> I feel... [feel]

- Feel
    - What is your wallflowers gut reaction?
    - Pick a feeling from the [wheel](#feeling-wheel) or [list](#feeling-list)

Example

> I am Azalea. I am a wallflower. Alone...
>
> I see... the cheer squad laughing in the corner.
>
> I think... must be nice to fit in.
>
> I feel... awkward.

### Bloom

Describe your wallflower joining or leaving the party. Why did they stop being a wallflower?

1. What is your wallflowers feeling? Pick a feeling from the [wheel](#feeling-wheel) or [list](#feeling-list)
2. Narrate a short vignette of your wallflower joining or leaving the party.


### Conflict Resolution

0. Don't contradict what has already been said.
1. If introducing something about the party context, other players need to agree.
2. Ask questions: What is the intent? How would it work?
3. Add to what has been said. "Yes, and...". We want to build off others ideas.

### Design Goals

- Quick setup.
- Give the experience of being a wallflower.
- Play with perspective.
- Reflect on how observation reveals the observer.

### FAQ

#### Can we play with other party contexts?

Yes. However you will need to discuss and agree on that shared context first.

Examples

- College Party
- Corporate Party

#### Can wallflowers observe each other?

No. Wallflowers are isolated and don't notice each other.

Reason: This would contradict the design goal of the wallflowers observations revealing themselves.



## Notes


- Your wallflowers reaction as the wallflwoer
- What do you see
- Fix large party of high school students
- Move read aloud to setup.
- Does the order matter? Describe someone verses feeling or just as long as the items are present?
- What is a gut reaction? How does that work?
- What happens if there are people in the scene you do or don't recognize.

- If your wallflower joined the party then you can totally use them as a character in scenes.

- Like: Interesting to describe character by reaction.
- Maybe know one thing about the wallflower? To determine reaction.
- Move selection - too much data - rapidly gain characters and connections - narrate in the fact

- liked having to name feelings and having a reference, thinking and then feeling

- what the party was for
- getting in the vibe - becoming the wallflower - mantra to get in the mood of being someone standing at the wall an not participating. evocation "I am X I am an wallflower" Story Poems style - literal text to get in the zone. Fedora Noir scripted.
- Why did you come to this party: "Think it don't say it"
- Put notes about the wallflower above - all reactions to scenes.

- Split person description and reaction or in turn order.

"The characters at the party are developing"
"I see, I feel, I think to myself"

- As a wallflower you don't get to decide what to react to other players always pick.

Tell them a thing and they react to it. Single Move

- Order verses picking. picking takes too long verses dictated. then swap order

- Person, Scene, Thing - describe an object at the party - you tell them what they see.


## Revise

On your turn describe something at the party: thing {space, sound, smell}, person, scene the wallflower observes. Or you may add a detail to something already described that the wallflower notices.

You don't have a close connection to anyone at the party.


The person above gives the wallflowers impression of that thing- then than person does the same.
Mantra for wallflower impression
I am [wallflower name]. I am a wallflower. Alone, I see... I think... I feel...
No one knows me.

If the players wallflower has bloomed then you may pick any remaining wallflower to observe.

Just describe the action joining the crowd fade into anonymity.

After 3 impressions then can bloom.

No one 'knows' you, you don't 'know' anyone.

Only describe don't allow blooming at all

How many rounds? 3? 5?
