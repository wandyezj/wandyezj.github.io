## Introduction

__Read the following aloud to everyone__

We are playing wallflowers at a large high school party.

Our game is about our wallflowers feelings and thoughts as they observe alone from the sidelines.

We reveal our wallflowers through their observations and impressions of others. In turn those impressions help our wallflowers discover themselves.

Who is your wallflower? Why are they here?

We find out when your wallflower blooms - joining or leaving the party.

## Play

### Overview

We will each play one wallflower at a large high school party in the present day.

The game takes place in a series of rounds. Players take turns in order. see [On your turn](#on-your-turn).

The games ends when all wallflowers bloom or players decide to have a final round.

### Setup

0. __Sections__ Write down the following sections:

    ```text
    # Wallflowers

    # Characters

    # Turns
    ```

1. __Turn order__ Decide on player turn order. Write down each players name in the wallflowers section. Turn order will be from first to last, then loop around.  

    ```text
    # Wallflowers

    - Ace
    - Ben
    - Cal
    - Dan
    ```

2. __Aliases__ Give each wallflower an alias named after a flower. Each player should pick their own alias. See [Flower List](#flower-list).

    Each flower alias should be a single word, and start with a different letter. Write down the aliases next to each player in the wallflowers section.

    ```text
    # Wallflowers

    - Azalea (Ace)
    - Begonia (Ben)
    - Camellia (Cal)
    - Dahlia (Dan)

    ```

3. __Stop__ We're done with setup! We don't know anything else about the wallflowers. We will discover everything about our wallflowers through play.


### On Your Turn

On your turn you may do one of the following actions:

- [__Glance__](#glance) - your wallower sees someone they don't know.
- [__Recognize__](#recognize) - your wallflower sees someone they know.
- [__Scene__](#scene) - create a scene for another players wallflower to observe.
- [__Bloom__](#bloom) - your wallflower joins or leaves the party.

#### Glance

Your wallflower glimpses someone at the party they don't know.

0. What is your wallflowers gut reaction to this person? Pick a feeling from the [wheel](#feeling-wheel) or [list](#feeling-list). You may add additional feelings.
1. What does this person look like? What are they wearing?
2. Give this person a moniker. Example "Redhead with glasses"
3. Write this person under characters and which wallflower observed them along with the wallflowers impression.

note: multiple wallflowers may glance at the same character.

#### Recognize

Your wallflower sees someone at the party they recognize.

0. What is your wallflowers gut reaction to this person? Pick a feeling from the [wheel](#feeling-wheel) or [list](#feeling-list). You may add additional feelings.
1. What is this persons name?
2. Where does your wallflower know them from?
3. What does this person look like? What are they wearing?
4. Write this character under characters along with which wallflower observed them and the wallflowers impression.

Example

```text
(Fear and Guilt) Oh Shit! It's Brad from Chemistry class, he's so nice. He let me borrow his text book, and I haven't given it back.
```

note: multiple wallflowers may recognize a character.

#### Scene

Create a scene for one or more wallflowers to observe.

1. Observers
    - Choose one or more observing wallflowers. (You must pick another players wallflower)
2. Actors
    - Who is there? Pick only from already described characters.
3. Backdrop
    - Describe the background activity to this scene and where the characters are.
4. Action
    - Action is done as a silent film.
    - Describe the action in terms of what the wallflower would observe. What are the characters doing? Don't describe anything the wallflower can't observe. For example: the wallflower can't observe what the characters are thinking or feeling.
5. Impression
    - For each player observing:
        - What is your wallflowers gut reaction to this scene? Pick a feeling from the [wheel](#feeling-wheel) or [list](#feeling-list)

#### Bloom

Describe your wallflower joining or leaving the party. Why did they stop being a wallflower?

0. What is your wallflowers feeling? Pick a feeling from the [wheel](#feeling-wheel) or [list](#feeling-list)
1. Narrate a short vignette of your wallflower joining or leaving the party.
2. If your wallflower joined the party name your wallflower and write them down under characters.

This wallflower may no longer be played. You may only play scenes on your turn going forward.


### Conflict Resolution

0. Don't contradict what has already been said.
1. If introducing something about the party context, other players need to agree.
2. Ask questions: What is the intent? How would it work?
3. Add to what has been said. "Yes, and...". We want to build off others ideas.

### Design Goals

- Quick setup.
- Give the experience of being a wallflower.
- Play with perspective.
- Reflect on how observation reveals the observer.

### FAQ

#### Can we play with other party contexts?

Yes. However you will need to discuss and agree on that shared context first.

Examples

- College Party
- Corporate Party

#### Can wallflowers observe each other?

No. Wallflowers are isolated and don't notice each other.

Reason: This would contradict the design goal of the wallflowers observations revealing themselves.




##### Notes

- Your wallflowers reaction as the wallflwoer
- What do you see
- Fix large party of high school students
- Move read aloud to setup.
- Does the order matter? Describe someone verses feeling or just as long as the items are present?
- What is a gut reaction? How does that work?
- What happens if there are people in the scene you do or don't recognize.

- If your wallflower joined the party then you can totally use them as a character in scenes.

- Like: Interesting to describe character by reaction.
- Maybe know one thing about the wallflower? To determine reaction.
- Move selection - too much data - rapidly gain characters and connections - narrate in the fact

- liked having to name feelings and having a reference, thinking and then feeling

- what the party was for
- getting in the vibe - becoming the wallflower - mantra to get in the mood of being someone standing at the wall an not participating. evocation "I am X I am an wallflower" Story Poems style - literal text to get in the zone. Fedora Noir scripted.
- Why did you come to this party: "Think it don't say it"
- Put notes about the wallflower above - all reactions to scenes.

- Split person description and reaction or in turn order.

"The characters at the party are developing"
"I see, I feel, I think to myself"

- As a wallflower you don't get to decide what to react to other players always pick.

Tell them a thing and they react to it. Single Move

- Order verses picking. picking takes too long verses dictated. then swap order

- Person, Scene, Thing - describe an object at the party - you tell them what they see.
