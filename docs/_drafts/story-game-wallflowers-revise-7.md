# Wallflowers

Wallflowers is a game for 3 - 4 players.

Decide on a facilitator to lead everyone through the rules.

Read the following aloud to everyone:

> __!!!WARNING!!!__ This game can be emotionally intense. Watch yourself - let other players know if you are uncomfortable. Watch others - it's ok to ask if people are comfortable.

## Introduction

Read the following aloud to everyone:

> We are playing wallflowers - in high school - at a large house party.
>
> Your wallflower showed up to the party by themselves, and is now watching the party alone from the sidelines.
>
> Who is your wallflower? Why are they here?
>
> What do our wallflower see, think, and feel, as they observe the party unfold?
>
> Do they want to join the party or leave?

## Setup

(1) __Aliases__

Each player will play one wallflower.

> Pick out an alias for your wallflower named after a flower.

Each alias must be a single word flower name and start with a different letter.

Pick from the list below or create your own:

```text
Azalea
Begonia
Camellia
Dahlia
Goldenrod
Hyacinth
Lavender
Marigold
Orchid
Poppy
Rose
Sunflower
Tulip
Violet
```

(2) __Turn order__ Decide on player turn order.

Write down each wallflower's alias and player's names in a section titled `Wallflowers`.

Turn order will be from first to last, then loop around.  

Example:

```text
Wallflowers

- Azalea (Ace)
- Begonia (Ben)
- Camellia (Cal)
- Dahlia (Dan)
```


(3) __Stop__

> We're done with setup! We don't know anything else about the wallflowers. We will discover everything about our wallflowers through play.


## Rounds

The game takes place across five rounds.

Each round has an opening line.

```text
Rounds

Early in the evening, not many people are here yet.

It's still early in the evening, people are arriving and socializing.

In the middle of the night, the house is packed, the music is up.

It's still the middle of the night, the energy 

(Bloom) It's late, the party is starting to wind down, some people ar starting to leave, others are settling into quieter conversations.
```


In the first four rounds players take turns describing something at the party and giving their wallflowers impression.

In the final `(bloom)` round have your wallflower __Bloom__.

At the beginning of each round, read the opening for the round.

## Turn

__Party__

On your turn describe something at the party the wallflower above you notices. This might be an object, person, scene, or detail.

Only describe what the wallflower can directly observe.

- Do NOT use any judgement words.
- Do NOT describe what the wallflower might know, think, or feel.

Examples

> A buff guy with a huge smile on his face walks past. He's wearing a baseball cap with the high school Griffin mascot, a T-Shirt with that says "Rock Punks" in gigantic pink letters, and shorts paired with socks and sandals - showing off incredibly smooth legs.

> A group of guys from the football team, squashed together on the while couch are staring at the TV, and suddenly jump up cheering, a bowl of popcorn tumbles onto the floor flinging popcorn everywhere.

> A girl tightly griping a boys hand drags him to the front door. Her brows are furrowed and tears wet her cheeks.

> A group of girls from the cheer squad dressed in matching hoodies and sweat pants are in a circle in the corner laughing so loudly you can hear it across the room.

> A big guy with a scowl on his face shoves past you growling "Watch it". He reeks of BO, and his slick sweat smears across your arms.


__Impression__

The player above you in the turn order now narrates their wallflowers impression in the 3rd person.

Describe what your wallflower is pays attention to. What do they think and how do they feel about what the observed?

Based on your wallflower's reaction do they want to join or leave the party?


> We see Azalea alone.
>
> Azalea sees... the cheer squad laughing in the corner. Must be nice to fit in, and feels awkward. 
>
> Azalea wants to... join the party.


## Bloom

On your turn ask the player above you if your wallflower joins or leaves the party.

Describe your wallflower joining or leaving the party. Why did they stop being a wallflower?

1. What is your wallflowers feeling? Pick a feeling from the [wheel](#feeling-wheel) or [list](#feeling-list)
2. Narrate a short vignette of your wallflower joining or leaving the party.


## Conflict Resolution

0. Don't contradict what has already been said.
1. If introducing something about the party context, other players need to agree.
2. Ask questions: What is the intent? How would it work?
3. Add to what has been said. "Yes, and...". We want to build off others ideas.

## FAQ

### Why narrate from the 3rd person?

I think it helps player more safely explore their wallflower.

Narrating in the 1st person often increases the risk characters bleed.

### Can we play with other party contexts?

Yes. However you will need to discuss and agree on that shared context first.

Examples

- College Party
- Corporate Party

### Can wallflowers observe each other?

No. Wallflowers are isolated and don't notice each other.

Reason: This would contradict the design goal of the wallflowers observations revealing themselves.

## Thoughts

Would it be better to allow players to bloom when they want?

Would it be better to let players repeat rounds if they want?
