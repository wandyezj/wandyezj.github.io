# Wallflowers

Wallflowers is a game for 3 - 4 players.

Decide on a facilitator to lead everyone through the rules.

Read the following aloud to everyone:

> __!!!WARNING!!!__ This game can be emotionally intense. Watch yourself - let other players know if you are uncomfortable. Watch others - it's always ok to ask if people are comfortable.

## Introduction

Read the following aloud to everyone:

> We are playing wallflowers - in high school - at a large house party.
>
> Your wallflower showed up to the party by themselves, and is now watching the party alone from the sidelines.
>
> Initially, you know nothing about your wallflower except their alias.
>
> What does your wallflower see, think, and feel - as they watch the party unfold?
>
> Do they want to join the party or leave?
>
> Don't try to answer yet! You will discover everything about your wallflower through play.

## Setup

(1) __Aliases__

Each player will play one wallflower.

> Pick an alias for your wallflower named after a flower.

Each alias must be a single word flower name and start with a different letter.

Pick from the list below or create your own:

```text
Azalea
Begonia
Camellia
Dahlia
Goldenrod
Hyacinth
Lavender
Marigold
Orchid
Poppy
Rose
Sunflower
Tulip
Violet
```


(2) __Turn order__

Create the wallflower deck.

Give each player a blank index card, and have them write down their name and wallflower alias on one side, leaving the back blank.

```text
Wallflower Name
(Player Name)
```

Example

```text
Azalea
(Ace)
```

Draw one card, that player goes first each round, play proceeds to the right.

(3) __Stop__

> We're done with setup! We don't know anything else about the wallflowers. We will discover everything about our wallflowers through play.

## Rounds

The game takes place across five rounds.

In the first four rounds players take turns describing something at the party and giving their wallflowers impression.

In the final round have your wallflower __Bloom__.


Each round has an opening line and rule for introducing something to the party.

```text
Rounds

(I) It's early in the evening, not many people are here yet.
    Party: Introduce something new.

(II) It's still early in the evening, people are arriving and socializing.
    Party: Introduce something new or something that builds on something another player has said.

(III) It's the middle of the night, the house is packed, the music is up.
    Party: Introduce something that builds on something another player has said.

(IV) It's still the middle of the night, the music and energy have shifted to be more relaxed.
    Party: Introduce something that builds on something another player has said.

(V) (Bloom) It's late, the party is starting to wind down, some people are starting to leave, others are settling into quieter conversations.
```

At the beginning of each round:

- Shuffle the wallflower deck, and deal one card to each player face down.
- Read the opening line for the round.

Have each player take their turn in order.

## Turn

__Party__

On your turn:

(1) Flip over the wallflower card in front of you.
(2) Describe something at the party that wallflower notices. This might be an object, person, scene, or detail.

In Round:

- I - introduce something new.
- II - introduce something new or you may build on something another player has introduced.
- III & IV - build on something another player has introduced.

Only describe what the wallflower can directly observe.

- Do NOT use any judgement words.
- Do NOT describe what the wallflower might know, think, or feel.
- Do NOT describe any interaction with the wallflower.

Examples

> A buff guy with a huge smile on his face walks past. He's wearing a baseball cap with the high school Griffin mascot, a T-Shirt with that says "Rock Punks" in gigantic pink letters, and shorts paired with socks and sandals - showing off incredibly smooth legs.

> A group of guys from the football team, squashed together on the while couch are staring at the TV, and suddenly jump up cheering, a bowl of popcorn tumbles onto the floor flinging popcorn everywhere.

> A girl tightly griping a boys hand drags him to the front door. Her brows are furrowed and tears wet her cheeks.

> A group of girls from the cheer squad dressed in matching hoodies and sweat pants are in a circle in the corner laughing so loudly you can hear it across the room.


__Impression__

The player on the wallflower card narrates their wallflowers impression in the 3rd person.

Describe what your wallflower pays attention to. What do they think? How do they feel about what they observed?

Based on your wallflower's reaction do they want to join or leave the party?


> We see Azalea alone.
>
> Azalea sees... the cheer squad laughing in the corner. Must be nice to fit in, and feels awkward.
>
> Azalea wants to... join the party.


## Bloom

On your turn ask the other players if your wallflower joins or leaves the party. Why?

Decide if your wallflower joins or leaves the party.

Describe your wallflower joining or leaving. Why did they stop being a wallflower?

1. What is your wallflowers feeling?
2. Narrate a short vignette of your wallflower joining or leaving the party.


## Conflict Resolution

0. Don't contradict what has already been said.
1. If introducing something about the party context, other players need to agree.
2. Ask questions: What is the intent? How would it work?
3. Add to what has been said. "Yes, and...". We want to build off others ideas.

## FAQ

### Why narrate from the 3rd person?

I think it helps player more safely explore their wallflower.

Narrating in the 1st person often increases the risk characters bleed.

### Can we play with other party contexts?

Yes. However you will need to discuss and agree on that shared context with other players.

Examples

- College Party
- Corporate Party

### Can wallflowers observe each other?

No. Wallflowers are isolated and don't notice each other.

Reason: This would contradict the design goal of the wallflowers observations revealing themselves.

### Why randomize the wallflower you narrate the party to?

Wallflowers don't get to choose what they see.

I want different players to have a chance to narrate to other wallflowers.
