## Introduction

Read the following aloud to everyone:

> We are playing wallflowers - in high school - at a large house party.
>
> Your wallflower showed up to the party by themselves, and is now watching the party alone from the sidelines.
>
> Initially, you know nothing about your wallflower except their alias.
>
> What does your wallflower see, think, and feel - as they watch the party unfold?
>
> Do they want to join the party or leave?
>
> Don't try to answer yet! You will discover everything about your wallflower through play.

## Setup

### (1) Aliases

Each player will play one wallflower.

> Pick an alias for your wallflower named after a flower.
>
> Each alias must be a single word flower name and start with a different letter.

Pick from the list below or create your own:

```text
Azalea
Begonia
Camellia
Dahlia
Goldenrod
Hyacinth
Lavender
Marigold
Orchid
Poppy
Rose
Sunflower
Tulip
Violet
```

Have each player write down their name and their wallflower's name.

__For in person play:__

Create an identity card. 

1. Give each player an index card, and have them fold it in half to make a tent.
2. Write your wallflower alias and player name on both sides.
    ```text
    Wallflower Alias
    (Player Name)
    ```
3. Place the card in front of you so everyone can see.


Example:

```text
Azalea
(Ace)
```

__For online play:__

In a shared document, write a list of each wallflower alias and player name in a section titled 'Wallflowers'.

Example:

```text
Wallflowers

- Azalea (Ace)
- Begonia (Ben)
- Camellia (Cal)
- Dahlia (Dan)
```

Clockwise is considered down.

After the last player in the list - loop back the the top.

### (2) Turn order

__For in person play__

Create the player deck.

1. Give each player a blank index card and have them write down their _name_ in parentheses on one side, leaving the back blank.
2. Collect these index cards - this is the player deck

Example

```text
(Ace)
```

Create the wallflower deck.

1. Give each player a blank index card and have them write down their _wallflower alias_ on one side, leaving the back blank.
2. Collect these index cards.

Example

```text
Azalea
```

### For online play

The facilitator will create both decks of cards, they will shuffle and draw for everyone as required.

### (3) Stop

Read the following out loud:

> We're done with setup! We don't know anything else about the wallflowers. We will discover everything about our wallflowers through play.

## Rounds

The game takes place across five rounds.

In the first four rounds players take turns describing something at the party that wallflowers notice.

In the final round all wallflowers __Bloom__.

Each round has an opening line and rule for introducing something to the party.

```text
Rounds

(I) It's early in the evening, not many people are here yet.
    Party: Introduce something new.

(II) It's still early in the evening, people are arriving and socializing.
    Party: Introduce something new or something that builds on something another player has said.

(III) It's the middle of the night, the house is packed, the music is up.
    Party: Introduce something that builds on something another player has said.

(IV) It's still the middle of the night, the music and energy have shifted to be more relaxed.
    Party: Introduce something that builds on something another player has said.

(V) (Bloom) It's late, the party is starting to wind down, some people are starting to leave, others are settling into quieter conversations.
```

At the beginning of each round:

1. __Hide Wallflowers__
    - Collect the wallflower cards and shuffle them. Deal one card to each player face down. Do __NOT__ peak!
2. __Draw Opening Player__
    - Shuffle the player deck. Draw one card. The drawn player reads the opening line for the round and goes first.

Turns proceed clockwise

## Turn

On your turn:

1. [Party](#party) - Describe something at the party a wallflower notices. This might be an object, person, scene, or detail.
2. [Impression](#impression) Who's watching?
    - Flip over the wallflower card in front of you. The player that owns that wallflower narrates their wallflower's impression.
    - _Special_: If the wallflower alias is your wallflower: two wallflowers narrate their impression.
        1. Shuffle the player deck and draw a card (if you draw your own name - draw again). That player narrates their wallflowers impression.
        2. Once that player has finished narrating their impression, narrate your wallflower's impression.


### Party

In Round:

- I - introduce something new.
- II - introduce something new or you may build on something another player has introduced.
- III & IV - build on something another player has introduced.

Only describe what the wallflower can directly observe.

- Do NOT use any judgement words.
- Do NOT describe what the wallflower might know, think, or feel.
- Do NOT describe any interaction with the wallflower.

Examples

> A buff guy with a huge smile on his face walks past. He's wearing a baseball cap with the high school Griffin mascot, a T-Shirt with that says "Rock Punks" in gigantic pink letters, and shorts paired with socks and sandals - showing off incredibly smooth legs.

> A group of guys from the football team, squashed together on the while couch are staring at the TV, and suddenly jump up cheering, a bowl of popcorn tumbles onto the floor flinging popcorn everywhere.

> A girl tightly griping a boys hand drags him to the front door. Her brows are furrowed and tears wet her cheeks.

> A group of girls from the cheer squad dressed in matching hoodies and sweat pants are in a circle in the corner laughing so loudly you can hear it across the room.


### Impression

The player who controls the selected wallflower narrates their wallflowers impression in the 3rd person.

Describe what your wallflower pays attention to. What do they think? How do they feel about what they observed?

Based on your wallflower's reaction do they want to join or leave the party?


> We see Azalea alone.
>
> Azalea sees... the cheer squad laughing in the corner. Must be nice to fit in, and feels awkward.
>
> Azalea wants to... join the party.


## Bloom

On your turn ask the other players if your wallflower joins or leaves the party. Why?

Decide if your wallflower joins or leaves the party.

Describe your wallflower joining or leaving. Why did they stop being a wallflower?

1. What is your wallflowers feeling?
2. Narrate a short vignette of your wallflower joining or leaving the party.


## Conflict Resolution

0. Don't contradict what has already been said.
1. If introducing something about the party context, other players need to agree.
2. Ask questions: What is the intent? How would it work?
3. Add to what has been said. "Yes, and...". We want to build off others ideas.

## FAQ

### Why narrate from the 3rd person?

I think it helps player more safely explore their wallflower.

Narrating in the 1st person often increases the risk characters bleed.

### Can we play with other party contexts?

Yes. However you will need to discuss and agree on that shared context with other players.

Examples

- College Party
- Corporate Party

### Can wallflowers observe each other?

No. Wallflowers are isolated and don't notice each other.

Reason: This would contradict the design goal of the wallflowers observations revealing themselves.

### Why randomize which player starts each round?

I want different players to take turns reading the rounds starting line.

The first description of what is happening at the party can have a lot of influence on the rest of the round. I want to get different players ideas.

### Why randomize wallflower impressions?

Wallflowers don't get to choose what they see.

I want different players to have a chance to narrate to other wallflowers.

### Why hide which wallflower has an impression from the narrator?

The party action is explicitly separate from the wallflowers.

The wallflowers are on the sidelines, they should not be considered in a players narration of party events.

I want the player doing narration to be free to narrate what happens at the party.

### Why deal out the wallflowers face down to each player instead of drawing from the deck?

Both drawing and dealing and flipping are equivalently random.

I think there is a difference in feel.

When you have the card that is the wallflower, I think people become more curious as to who it is, and there is a more anticipation when you get to flip it.

It makes it easier for players to identify if the wallflower matches the player. Since the wallflower card should be in front of the player's identity card.
