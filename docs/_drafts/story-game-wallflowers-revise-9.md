One player to be a facilitator to lead everyone through the rules.

__For in person play__

- Blank Index cards
- Pens

__For online play__

- A video chat client so everyone can see and hear each other.
- A shared document everyone can view and edit.

## Introduction

Read the following aloud to everyone:

> We are playing wallflowers - in high school - at a large house party.
>
> Your wallflower showed up to the party by themselves, and is now watching the party alone from the sidelines.
>
> Initially, you know nothing about your wallflower except their alias.
>
> What does your wallflower see, think, and feel - as they watch the party unfold?
>
> Do they want to join the party or leave?
>
> Don't try to answer yet! You will discover everything about your wallflower through play.

## Setup

### (1) Aliases

Each player will play one wallflower.

> Pick an alias for your wallflower named after a flower.
>
> Each alias must be a single word flower name and start with a different letter.

Pick from the list below or create your own:

```text
Azalea
Begonia
Camellia
Dahlia
Goldenrod
Hyacinth
Lavender
Marigold
Orchid
Poppy
Rose
Sunflower
Tulip
Violet
```

Have each player write down their name and their wallflower's name.

__For in person play:__

To help everyone keep track of who is playing which wallflower:

1. Give each player an index card, and have them fold it in half to make a tent.
2. Write your wallflower alias and player name on both sides.

    ```text
    Wallflower Alias
    (Player Name)
    ```

3. Place the card in front of you so everyone can see.


Example:

```text
Azalea
(Ace)
```

__For online play:__

In a shared document, write a list of each wallflower alias and player name in a section titled 'Wallflowers'.

Example:

```text
Wallflowers

- Azalea (Ace)
- Begonia (Ben)
- Camellia (Cal)
- Dahlia (Dan)
```

Clockwise is considered down.

After the last player in the list - loop back the the top.

### (2) Wallflower Deck

__For in person play__

Create the wallflower deck.

1. Give each player a blank index card and have them write down their _wallflower alias_ on one side, leaving the back blank.

    ```text
    Wallflower Alias
    ```

    Example

    ```text
    Azalea
    ```

2. Collect these index cards.

__For online play__

The facilitator will create the deck of cards, they will shuffle and draw for everyone as required.

### (3) Stop

Read the following out loud:

> We're done with setup! We don't know anything else about the wallflowers. We will discover everything about our wallflowers through play.

## Rounds

The game takes place across five rounds.

In the first four rounds players take turns describing something at the party that _all_ wallflowers notice. However, while all wallflowers notice what happens _only one_ wallflower will be chosen to narrate their inner thoughts to all players. Every round, every player will narrate once, and give their wallflowers impression once.

In the final round all wallflowers __Bloom__.

Each round has an opening line and rule for introducing something to the party.

```text
Rounds

(I) It's early in the evening, not many people are here yet.
    Party: Introduce something new.

(II) It's still early in the evening, people are arriving and socializing.
    Party: Introduce something new or something that builds on something another player has said.

(III) It's the middle of the night, the house is packed, the music is up.
    Party: Introduce something that builds on something another player has said.

(IV) It's still the middle of the night, the music and energy have shifted to be more relaxed.
    Party: Introduce something that builds on something another player has said.

(V) (Bloom) It's late, the party is starting to wind down, some people are starting to leave, others are settling into quieter conversations.
```

At the beginning of each round:

1. __Rotate Opening Player__
    - Rotate the opening player clockwise. This way, in a four player game, everyone will get to open the round at least once.
2. __Opening Player__
    - Read the opening line for the round and narrate first.

Turns proceed clockwise

## Turn

On your turn:

1. [Party](#party) - Describe something at the party the wallflowers notice. This might be an object, person, scene, or detail.
2. Read
    > Our wallflowers all saw this. What are your wallflower thoughts? What are they feeling?
3. Pause
    - Give players time to think about their wallflower.
    - Think about how your own wallflower feels.
    - After a minute, ask if everyone is ready if they are selected.
4. Select
    - One wallflower reveals their impression.
    - Draw a card from the wallflower deck. If you draw your own card, set it aside, draw again, then shuffle your own card back in.
    - Hand the player their wallflower card, removing it from the deck for the rest of the round. Each wallflower reacts only once per round
5. [Impression](#impression) - Have the selected players wallflower give their impression.


### Party

Describe something at the party the wallflowers notice. This might be an object, person, scene, or detail.

In Round:

- I - introduce something new.
- II - introduce something new or you may build on something another player has introduced.
- III & IV - build on something another player has introduced.

Only describe what the wallflower can directly observe.

- Do NOT use any judgement words.
- Do NOT describe what the wallflower might know, think, or feel.
- Do NOT describe any interaction with the wallflower.

Examples

> A buff guy with a huge smile on his face walks past. He's wearing a baseball cap with the high school Griffin mascot, a T-Shirt with that says "Rock Punks" in gigantic pink letters, and shorts paired with socks and sandals - showing off incredibly smooth legs.

> A group of guys from the football team, squashed together on the white couch, are staring at the TV, and suddenly jump up cheering - a bowl of popcorn tumbles onto the floor, flinging popcorn everywhere.

> A girl tightly gripping a boys hand drags him to the front door. Her brows are furrowed and tears wet her cheeks.

> A group of girls from the cheer squad dressed in matching hoodies and sweat pants are in a circle in the corner laughing so loudly you can hear it across the room.


### Impression

The player who controls the selected wallflower narrates their wallflowers impression in the 3rd person.

Describe what your wallflower pays attention to. What do they think? How do they feel about what they observed?

Based on your wallflower's reaction do they want to join or leave the party?


> We see Azalea alone.
>
> Azalea sees... the cheer squad laughing in the corner. Must be nice to fit in, and feels awkward.
>
> Azalea wants to... join the party.


## Bloom

On your turn ask the other players if your wallflower joins or leaves the party. Why?

Decide if your wallflower joins or leaves the party.

Describe your wallflower joining or leaving. Why did they stop being a wallflower?

1. What is your wallflowers feeling?
2. Narrate a short vignette of your wallflower joining or leaving the party.


## Conflict Resolution

0. Don't contradict what has already been said.
1. If introducing something about the party context, other players need to agree.
2. Ask questions: What is the intent? How would it work?
3. Add to what has been said. "Yes, and...". We want to build off others ideas.

## FAQ

### Why narrate from the 3rd person?

I think it helps player more safely explore their wallflower.

Narrating in the 1st person often increases the risk characters bleed.

### Can we play with other party contexts?

Yes. However you will need to discuss and agree on that shared context with other players.

Examples

- College Party
- Corporate Party

### Can wallflowers observe each other?

No. Wallflowers are isolated and don't notice each other.

Reason: This would contradict the design goal of the wallflowers observations revealing themselves.

### Why rotate which player starts each round?

I want different players to take turns reading the rounds starting line.

The first description of what is happening at the party can have a lot of influence on the rest of the round. I want to get different players' ideas.

Additionally, this balances out the wallflower desks draw probability.

### Why have every wallflower see every narration?

I want a shared story everyone builds on.

The central thread is the party that every player contributes to. Each player weaves their wallflower's thread around this central thread. Each player sees their full wallflower thread, while other players only see a quarter of each wallflower's thread. This can make for surprising reveals at the end.

It's much easier for players if every wallflower to sees everything at the party. It is far too hard for players to separate out what each wallflower knows.

The narrator for each round isn't aware of which wallflower will give their impression. So every wallflower needs to be aware of what's going on.

### Why randomize wallflower impressions?

Wallflowers don't get to choose what they see.

I want players to stay engaged - there is a possibility their wallflower will be called on.

I want different players to have a chance to respond to other players narration.

### Why hide which wallflower has an impression from the narrator?

The party action is explicitly separate from the wallflowers.

The wallflowers are on the sidelines, they should not be considered in a players narration of party events.

I want the player doing narration to be free to narrate what happens at the party.
