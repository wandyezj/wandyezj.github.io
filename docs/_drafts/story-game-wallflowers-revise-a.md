# Wallflowers

Wallflowers is a game for 3 - 4 players.

> __!!!WARNING!!!__ This game can be emotionally intense. Watch yourself - let other players know if you are uncomfortable. Watch others - it's always ok to ask if people are comfortable.

## What you need to play

3-4 players.

One player to be a facilitator to lead everyone through the rules.

- Blank Index cards
- Pens
- (optional) Token to track whose turn it is.

## Introduction

Read the following aloud:

> We are playing wallflowers at a large party.
>
> Your wallflower showed up to the party by themselves, and is now watching the party alone from the sidelines.
>
> Initially, you know nothing about your wallflower except their alias.
>
> What does your wallflower see, think, and feel - as they watch the party unfold?
>
> Do they want to join the party or leave?
>
> Don't try to answer yet! You will discover everything about your wallflower through play.

## Setup

### (1) Aliases

Read the following aloud:

> Each player will play one wallflower.
>
> Pick an alias for your wallflower named after a flower.
>
> Each alias must be a single word flower name and start with a different letter.
>
> Pick from the list below or create your own:

```text
Azalea
Begonia
Camellia
Dahlia
Erysimum
Foxglove
Goldenrod
Hyacinth
Indigo
Jasmine
Kudzu
Lotus
Marigold
Nerine
Orchid
Poppy
Quince
Rose
Sage
Tulip
Ulmus
Violet
Willow
Xanthium
Yarrow
Zenobia
```

To help everyone keep track of who is playing each wallflower:

Have each player write down their name and their wallflower's name on a folded index card and place it in front of them.

1. Give each player an index card and a pen.
2. > Fold your index card in half to make a tent.
3. > Write down your _wallflower alias_ and your name on both sides:

    ```text
    Wallflower Alias
    (Player Name)
    ```

    Example:

    ```text
    Azalea
    (Ace)
    ```

4. > Place the card in front of you so everyone can see.


### (2) Wallflower Deck

Create the wallflower deck.

1. Give each player a blank index card and have them write down their _wallflower alias_ on one side, leaving the back blank.

    ```text
    Wallflower Alias
    ```

    Example

    ```text
    Azalea
    ```

2. Collect these index cards.


### (3) Set the party

> What type of party are we playing?

1. Pick an age range for our wallflowers:

    - High School
    - College

2. Pick a setting:

    - House party at a wealthy house
    - Kegger in the woods
    - Bonfire on the beach


### (4) Stop

Read the following aloud:

> We're done with setup! We don't know anything else about the wallflowers. We will discover everything about our wallflowers through play.

## Seed

1. Read the following aloud:

    > Before your wallflower arrives at the party, they are thinking about someone else who might be there.
    >
    > Each wallflower is thinking about a different person.
    >
    > Who is your wallflower thinking about?
    >
    > What do they think about this person? What do they feel?

2. Shuffle the wallflower deck.
3. Draw each wallflower in turn, and have the person playing the wallflower narrate their wallflower's thoughts.

- The goal of this round is to create characters our wallflowers might see at the party.
- Each player must have their wallflower think about a different person.

## Grow

In each grow round players take turns describing something at the party _all_ wallflowers notice. However, while all wallflowers notice,  _only one_ wallflower will be chosen to narrate their inner thoughts to all players. Every round, every player will narrate once, and give their wallflowers impression once.

At the beginning of each round:

0. Collect the wallflower cards and shuffle the wallflower deck.
1. __Rotate Opening Player__
    - Rotate the opening player clockwise. This way, in a four player game, everyone opens the round once.
2. __Opening Player__
    - Read the opening line for the round and narrate first.

    ```text
    Opening Lines:

    (I) It's early in the evening, not many people are here yet.

    (II) It's still early in the evening, people are arriving and socializing.

    (III) It's the middle of the night, the house is packed, the music is up.

    (IV) It's still the middle of the night, the music and energy have shifted to be more relaxed.
    ```

3. Turns proceed clockwise.


### Turn

On your turn:

1. [Party](#party)
    - Describe something at the party the wallflowers notice. This might be an object, person, scene, or detail.
2. Read
    > Our wallflowers all saw this. What is your wallflowers impression? What are they thinking? What are they feeling?
3. Pause
    - Give players time to think in silence about their wallflower's impression.
    - Think about your own wallflower's impression.
    - After at least a minute, ask if everyone is ready.
4. Draw
    - Select a wallflower to reveal their thoughts.
        - The player who narrates should always be different from the player revealing their wallflower's impression.
        - Draw from the wallflower deck.
            - If you are the second to last player, check the deck to make sure the final player does not draw their own card.
            - If you draw your own card, set it aside, draw again, then shuffle your own card back in.
            - If you are the last player and draw your own card - Oops! Narrate your own wallflower's impression.
    - Hand the player their wallflower card, remove it from the deck for the rest of the round. Each wallflower reacts only once per round.
5. [Impression](#impression)
    - Have the selected player give their wallflower's impression.


### Party

Describe something at the party the wallflowers notice. This might be an object, person, scene, or detail.

In Round:

- I - Introduce something new.
- II - Introduce something new or build on something another player has introduced.
- III & IV - Build on something another player has introduced.

Only describe what the wallflower's can directly observe.

- Do NOT use any judgement words.
- Do NOT describe any interaction with a wallflower.
- Do NOT describe what a wallflower might know, think, or feel.

Examples

> A buff guy with a huge smile on his face walks past. He's wearing a baseball cap with the high school Griffin mascot, a T-Shirt with that says "Rock Punks" in gigantic pink letters, and shorts paired with socks and sandals - showing off incredibly smooth legs.

> A group of guys from the football team, squashed together on the white couch, are staring at the TV, and suddenly jump up cheering - a bowl of popcorn tumbles onto the floor, flinging popcorn everywhere.

> A girl tightly gripping a boys hand drags him to the front door. Her brows are furrowed and tears wet her cheeks.

> A group of girls from the cheer squad dressed in matching hoodies and sweat pants are in a circle in the corner laughing so loudly you can hear it across the room.


### Impression

The player who controls the selected wallflower narrates their wallflower's impression in the 3rd person.

Describe what your wallflower pays attention to. What do they think? How do they feel about what they observed?

Based on your wallflower's reaction do they want to join or leave the party?

Only describe what your wallflower is thinking or feeling.

- Your wallflower may __NOT__ take action.
- Your wallflower may __NOT__ join or leave the party.


Example:

> We see Azalea alone.
>
> Azalea sees... the cheer squad laughing in the corner. Must be nice to fit in, and feels awkward.
>
> Azalea wants to... join the party.


## Bloom

1. Read the following aloud:

    > It's late, the party is starting to wind down, some people are starting to leave, others are settling into quieter conversations.
    >
    > Does your wallflower join or leave the party?

2. Shuffle the wallflower deck.
3. Draw from the wallflower deck and have wallflower go as they are called.


On your turn:

1. Ask the other players if your wallflower joins or leaves the party. Why?
2. Decide if your wallflower joins or leaves the party.
3. Narrate a short vignette of your wallflower joining or leaving the party.
    - Why did they stop being a wallflower?
    - What is your wallflowers feeling?


## Conflict Resolution

0. Don't contradict what has already been said.
1. If introducing something about the party context, other players need to agree.
2. Ask questions: What is the intent? How would it work?
3. Add to what has been said. "Yes, and...". We want to build off others ideas.

## FAQ

### What changes for online play?

For online play you will need:

- A video chat client so everyone can see and hear each other.
- A shared document everyone can view and edit.

In the shared document, write a list of each wallflower alias and player name in a section titled 'Wallflowers'.

Example:

```text
Wallflowers

- Azalea (Ace)
- Begonia (Ben)
- Camellia (Cal)
- Dahlia (Dan)
```

Clockwise is considered down.

After the last player in the list - loop back the the top.

The facilitator will create the deck of cards, they will shuffle and draw for everyone as required.


### Can we play with other party contexts?

Yes. However you will need to discuss and agree on that shared context with other players.

Examples

- College Party
- Corporate Party

### Can wallflowers observe each other?

No. Wallflowers are isolated and don't notice each other.

Reason: This would contradict the design goal of the wallflowers observations revealing themselves.


### Why narrate from the 3rd person?

I think it helps player more safely explore their wallflower.

Narrating in the 1st person often increases the risk of character bleed.

### Why rotate which player starts each round?

I want different players to take turns reading the rounds starting line.

The first description of what is happening at the party can have a lot of influence on the rest of the round. I want to get different players' ideas.

Additionally, this balances the wallflower deck draw probability.


### Why randomize wallflower impressions?

Wallflowers don't get to choose what they see.

I want players to stay engaged - there is a possibility their wallflower will be called on.

I want different players to have a chance to respond to other players narration.

### Why hide which wallflower has an impression from the narrator?

The party action is explicitly separate from the wallflowers.

The wallflowers are on the sidelines, they should not be considered in a players narration of party events.

I want the player doing narration to be free to narrate what happens at the party.


### Why have every wallflower see every narration?

I want a shared story everyone builds on.

The central thread is the party - which every player contributes to. Each player weaves their wallflower's thread around this central thread.

Each player sees their wallflower's full thread, while other players only see a quarter of each wallflower's thread. This can make for surprising reveals at the end.

It's much easier for players if every wallflower sees everything at the party. It is far too hard for players to separate out what each wallflower knows.

The narrator for each round isn't aware of which wallflower will give their impression. So every wallflower needs to be aware of what's going on.

### Revisions

From Playtest of 9

- Sequencing explanation needs improvement - procedure should be linear.
- It's hard to start play, consider having each wallflower as an opening scene describe a person or group they think will be there and what they think of them
- Write out guidelines for playtest
- Release a playtest version
- Be clear on what to read out loud
- Separate rules from examples
- Have people describe a specific thing
- Describe alternative settings - like the woods
- Clearly explain you can't actually join or leave until bloom
- Clearly explain scene rules
    - What is happening right now
    - something specific
    - zoom in on a few people
- Clarify why it's the player verses the wallflower
- Update wording - build on something is clunky
- Flower names tend to be feminine - does this bias the players? Solution?
- Drawing randomly doesn't always work, look at the last so you don't narrate your own scene
- Really going for immersive
- Include player name on wallflower cards?
- Clarify deck drawing rules - for the last two cards. Explain overall goals
- Simplify game rule test.



Things that worked well

- Unexpected draw is solid
- Separation of party narration and wallflower reaction on different players is good
- Explanation of author intent is good - so people know what you are going for.


Possibly masculine flower names

- Lotus
- Aster


- Oak
- Pine
- Juniper
- Cypress
- Alder
