# Wallflowers

## Design Goal

Play with perspective. 
Show what observations reveal about the observer.

## Introduction

We are playing wallflowers at a large college party.

Generally, the party is chill, nothing dramatic or bad happens during the party itself - that's not what this is about.

Wallflowers is a journey of self discovery though observations of others. Our observations and impressions of others reveal more about ourselves, then they do about others.

Who is your wallflower? Why are they here?

Wallflowers don't interact with other guests at the party or with each other. Gameplay takes place solely though the observations, impressions, thoughts, and memories in the wallflowers minds. Critically, wallflowers are never a main character in scenes, they only observe, even in their memories.

How does it end? At some point you give up being a wallflower and join the party - you _are_ one of the characters - however, you can never be one of the characters you observed.

The narrative is non-linear - this means observations aren't necessarily done in order. Players only play wallflowers. Wallflowers operate as a duel existence switching between observing others however the characters at the party switches from being a character that wallflowers observe and being a wallflower observing others.

## Setup

Write down the following sections

```text
# Wallflowers

# Stereotypes

# Characters

# Scenes

# Turns
```

1. __Turn order__ Decide on player turn order. Write down each players name in the wallflowers section. Turn order will be from first to last, then loop around.  

    ```text
    # Wallflowers

    - Ace
    - Ben
    - Cal
    - Dan

    ```

2. __Aliases__ Give your wallflower an alias named after a flower. We will use this alias to refer to the wallflowers observations. Each player should pick out their own alias. Each flower should ne a single word, and start with a different letter. Write down the aliases next to each player in the wallflowers section.

    ```text
    # Wallflowers

    - Azalea (Ace)
    - Begonia (Ben)
    - Camellia (Cal)
    - Dahlia (Dan)

    ```

3. __Characters__ Write down each wallflower under characters.

## Play

On your turn you may do one of the following:

- __Stereotype__ Your wallflower sees a stereotype at the party. What does your wallflower think of them? Write down this stereotype under stereotypes.
- __Recognize__ Your wallflower sees someone at the party (who fits into a previously named stereotype) they recognize. What does your wallflower think of them? Give this character a name. Write them down under characters and which wallflower observed them.
- __Scene__ Describe an event from your wallflowers perspective that happens at the party. Who is there? (you may only use existing character concepts or names characters) What happens? Give the scene a short name. You may also extend an existing scene with details or another wallflower may give their own perspective on what happens. Write down the scene under scenes.
- __Flashback__ The same as a scene but this may take place before the party.
- __Actualize__ Name your wallflower as one of the characters at the party. It may __not__ be a character your wallflower previously observed. Merge the wallflower and character under characters.

Ending the game



Play or Dicta that happens at the party - who is there what's happening? 


- __Event__ Describe something that happens at the party - this isn't as a wallflower
- __Observe__ concepts and existing characters at the party. Feel free to give your wallflowers impression.
- __Recognize__ a concept at the party and give them a name.
- __Flashback__ to a memory of a specific character.
- __Actualize__ Name your wallflower as one of the characters at the party. It may __not__ be a character your wallflower previously observed. The wallflower is no longer a wallflower and may not be played further - but they may be observed by other wallflowers.
- __Switch__ Either, pick up an existing unowned wallflower, or create a new wallflower alias. If you currently have a wallflower that has not been actualized your existing wallflower, mark them unowned. 


## Scratch



Observe
- What are people doing

You are at a college 

The setting is a college party, everyone is playing a wallflowers.


What if all the players are wallflowers and observing people, you don't interact you just watch and think.
What is the fate? When do you end?

Premise it’s a large college party
Nothing dramatic or bad happens at the party - that’s not what this is about

Every player is a wallflower

No one knows who they are or what their name is

It’s a journey of self discovery - the observations reveal more about the characters making them than anything else

Each scene

Observe
Introduce character concepts - don’t need names yet
See reaction of another wallflower
Can body language but no speaking
Can wander around to another room
Can overhear
Flashback
Monologue

Wallflowers observe each other - can see expressions or where they are looking

Can’t do anything until

Answer the following 
Who you are
Why you are here
What is your name


Concepts
Specific and action based t through scene
Can inspire you to reflect by parallel or memory

Game is to play off what other people said

Rounds

Go through each player

## Thoughts

becoming another character at the party is strange when the name is wallflowers. It also gets away from the core experience.
