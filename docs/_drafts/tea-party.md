# Tea Party

Thoughts on hosting tea parties.

Time 1-4 after lunch and before dinner

- Everyone pick out their own unique teacup and tea
- Electric Kettle
- Teapots and looseleaf and Teabags

- Distinct cups allow everyone to easily identify their cup, you also don't need to worry about them matching if they are all unique. Size, Shape, Color, Material. A diverse set of cups increases the chance people find one the like. Plus if people pick it themselves they are more likely to remember which one is theirs. If you are there when they pick, you can also remember. Just make sure they are all cups that you like to look at.

- Multiple teas, and letting people pick which one, make sure you brew something they are interested in. The key is to pick and display only teas you are interested in drinking.

Have herbal tea that is decaffeinated.

Small Treats - at least two different types

Pick things that aren't too sweet and look cute.

- Walkers - Shortbread Thistle Rounds
- Simple mills Almond flour cookies Toasted Pecan
- Biscotti
