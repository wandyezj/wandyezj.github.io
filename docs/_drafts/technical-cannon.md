# Technical Cannon

I was at Powells Books in Portland and in the Rare book section I came across a set of 100 Greatest Books by Easton Press. These books tended to be books considered great literature in the Western Cannon. With some exceptions like Confucius and the Arabian Nights.

Every book well written and well renowned.

These books were very much in the Liberal Arts cannon. Someone versed on the Liberal Arts would be well read if they had read and understood the context and ideas behind these books.

Audiance, who should read the technical cannon? Generally should be targeted at everyone but with tiers of basic intermediate and advanced with an explanation of where the knowledge is useful since not everyone has the time or engergy to read every book all at once.

I then considered for a technical person what would a Technical Cannon look like?

By technical person I mean someone who wants to build effective systems which are a combination of both human and technical elements.

Priority of knowledge

Such a technical cannon would consider:

Basic

- Relationships
- Personal Health
    - Exercise, Cooking, First Aid
- Personal Management
    - Manage your money, household, Emergency preparedness
- Teaching & Mentorship

Core Applied Skills

- Writing
- Rhetoric
- Critical Thinking
- Storytelling
- Management of processes and people
- Mathematics
    - modeling, analyzing
- Science
    - Applying

Knowledge

- Science
- Engineering
- Government
- History
- Medicine
- Philosophies on society since technical implementation often has tremendous influence on the how of society.


Perhaps, such a technical cannon should stray away from philosophy and leave that to liberal arts and focus more on pragmatic problems like tradeoffs among different strategies.

This is what we have found to work.

Unlike the 100 Greatest books list, I think the list should be somewhat flexible, shorted and geared towards more of categories of books verses specific texts.

Looking for books that will fundamentally shift your perspective with practical applications to your life and the lives of others within your influence.
