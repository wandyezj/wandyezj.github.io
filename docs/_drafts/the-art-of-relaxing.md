# The Art of Relaxing

It's easy to become completely engrossed in (obsessed with) your work or other aspects of life.

Obsession and rumination and worrying about that

Relaxing can help you take your mind off work and explore other things.

How can something that requires find levels of concentration be relaxing?

Routine, getting into a habit.
