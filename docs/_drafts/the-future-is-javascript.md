# The Future is JavaScript

This essay is an exploration of the future of programming. This essay explores why JavaScript may continue to be a critical language in the decades ahead.

The JavaScript Programming Language is the language of the web. It continues to be the only programming language widely supported in modern web browsers. _note_ WebAssembly is a potential alternative but by design it lacks many of the features that make JavaScript flexible and useful.

Web Browsers can be thought of as the modern operating system that serves as a front end for nearly every modern application. 

A significant portion of the modern web (nearly every website with interactive elements) uses JavaScript. There is a significant economic investment in existing code, libraries, programmer knowledge, and tooling to support development. Few modern languages have the level of penetration JavaScript currently has.

JavaScript as a language is far from ideal. JavaScript lacks many features one would expect from a modern programming language - like a static type system. over the year the JavaScript community has patched glaring


WebAssembly

Fundamental ability to review code and statically analyze the results of the language is a powerful feature.

TypeScript

- Browser
- Server
- Application
- Embedded

- Application Extension -  Google Docs, Microsoft Office

Simple language with static analysis that is blockable and VM able.

TypeScript is fundamentally a JavaScript extension from its design principals.

Browser as a modern operating system.
