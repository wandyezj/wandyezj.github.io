## Philosophy

Each edition of the zine should be good enough where someone view it as something worthy to keep around.

Print small issues with 2 pages of 8.5 x 11, when have enough contents print a nice version that bundles issues together or selects the best of all issues.

The individual zines should be small enough to read through quickly.
