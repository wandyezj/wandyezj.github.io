## Philosophy

Writing to encourage people to play, to encourage experimentation.

Each edition of the zine should be good enough where someone view it as something worthy to keep around.

Print small issues with 2 pages of 8.5 x 11, when have enough contents print a nice version that bundles issues together or selects the best of all issues.

The individual zines should be small enough to read through quickly.

Should be something that can be read over a cup of coffee.
