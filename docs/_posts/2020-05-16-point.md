The prow of the sailboat slices the water leaving a parting wake behind.

The wake divides the water in two sides, one on the right and one on the left.

Multiple boats cut lines across the water.

The lines start at one point and end at another. Where the lines start and end it is ambiguous where the lines continue.

Some lines intersect, wakes clashing, leaving a messy cut off point.

There are infinite dimensions to arbitrarily slice.

These messy lines distinguish one thing from another; allowing the application of labels like right and left.
