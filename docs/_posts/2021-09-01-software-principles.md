# Software Principles

## Values

- Open
- Trust
- Accessible

### Open

Software is community driven. Open software must continually build and maintain community. Open software is a conversation between it's creators and consumers. Open software is open source and without restrictions. Consumers should be free to do as they please with the software unhindered by licenses. Any reasonably complex system must adapt to it's consumers as their needs change. Thus software must be open to change and accept contributions from the community it serves.

### Trust

Software must be trusted by the community it serves. Trust has to be earned from the community the software serves. Software can be trusted when it communicates: who builds it, for what purpose, how it works, what it does and it's limitations. Trust must be earned over time. Software must earn consumers trust that the software will continue to work even as it is adapted and modified. Software must earn consumers trust that it is secure and keeps their data safe.

### Accessible

Software must be accessible to the community it serves. The community must be able to download and use the software without great hurdles. Accessible software must be easy obtain, use, and learn about. Software must be usable by all potential community members.


## Specifics

- Keep computation on the consumers machine.
- Keep data on the consumers machine.
- Keep data secure from unauthorized access.
- Allow export of data in standard open file formats.
- Keep the pipeline that builds software secure from supply chain attacks.
- Build a positive community that is open and accepting of new members.
- Minimize non development costs.
- Communicate any changes to the software to the community and explain the reason for those changes.
- Install everything as part of the application don't rely on external dependencies, which can become deprecated and obsolete over time.
