- syntax error
    - A syntax error mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed.
- runtime error
    - A runtime error is a mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program. Programming languages define their own run-time errors.
- logic error
    - A logical error is a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly.

- program documentation
    - Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed.
- comments
    - Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people and do not affect how a program runs.

- iterative development process
    - An iterative development process requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process.
- incremental development process
    - An incremental development process is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole.

- procedure
    - A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. Also known as functions.
- parameters
    - Parameters are input variables of a procedure.
- arguments
    - Arguments specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called.

- testing
    - Testing uses defined inputs to ensure that an algorithm or program is producing the expected outcomes. Programmers use the results from testing to revise their algorithms or programs.

- code statement
    - A code statement is a part of program code that expresses an action to be carried out.
- expression
    - An expression can consist of a value, a variable, an operator, or a procedure call that returns a value.

- program input
    - Program input is data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text.
- events
    - Events are associated with an action and supplies input data to a program.
