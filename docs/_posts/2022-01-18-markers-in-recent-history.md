## Reasoning

### Why Jesus?

[AD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini)

### Why Jesus, Muhammad, Luther?

Religion.

### Why not Moses, Confucius, and Buddha?

- Moses (? > 1000 BCE)
- Confucius (551â€“479 BCE)
- Buddha (? 600 - 500 BCE)  

These leaders movements while extremely impactful, were founded much earlier and are outside the CE scope.

### Why American Civil War?

Slavery. Signals significantly changing attitudes about slavery which had existed for much of previous history.

_note_ Many people had opposed slavery long before the American Civil War, the American Civil War is simply a highlight of changing attitudes.

### Why the United States Constitutions 19th Amendment?

Women's Suffrage. Signals a change in the power possessed by women.

The Women's suffrage and Women's rights movements highlight the changing role of women in society.

The United States was not the first country to allow women to vote. Many European countries passed laws that gave women the right to vote in 1918 (Some countries passed laws before 1918).

Organization of women began far before the passage of women's suffrage laws. One example is the 1840 Seneca Falls Convention.

### Why Apollo 11?

Cold War. Technological Marvel.

### Why iPhone?

Exemplifies a new era of communication technology and instant access to information.
