Talented apartment owners and managers are always looking for ways to improve their clients living experience.

Small details can significantly improve resident satisfaction and help your building stand out from the competition.

Small details take some time and money, but overall they can be relatively inexpensive and low effort in the short term, and over the long term can significantly increase building reputation and appeal.

A short list of small details:

- Holiday decorations
    - It's not necessary to decorate for every holiday, that can be overwhelming for residents, however tasteful decorations for major neutral holidays like Christmas in the United States are a nice touch many residents appreciate.

- Gifts
    - Gifts are hard to get right. Gifts should feel premium and not cheap. It's also important to not overdo it so each gift feels special. What makes gifts hard is different residents preferences. A good gift needs to take into account the personal preferences of residents. A nice bottle of red wine at New Years is a gift many can appreciate. Keep in mind, not all residents drink, either for personal or religious reasons (red wine can also be used in cooking). Accompanying the gift with a note wishing them a happy New Year is critical to the gifts reception. If you know your residents well you can offer an alternative and keep track of their preferences, for example a bottle of fancy water for residents you know don't drink. The important part about gifts is residents coming away with the positive impression that you thought about them and appreciate them.
    - I recommend a gift to welcome new residents, a gift for New Years, and a gift for residents moving out.

- Art
    - Decorating empty halls with tasteful art can make an apartment building seem more homey. The trick is to find art that is neutral, non offensive, and arrange it in a pleasing manner. Art is a one time expense, you encourage residents to submit their own art, saving money and allowing residents to feel more ownership over the building.

- Delivering packages to residents doorsteps
    - Visible packages in the lobby encourage breakins to the building, potentially damaging the building. Missing packages upsets residents. A simple way to avoid this is to move packages in the lobby to outside of residents apartment unit. Residents typically appreciate not having to move their own packages. Moving packages as part of an Apartment Managers tasks also helps them have an excuse to move around the apartment building to check things out, and bump into residents to get to know them better. Moving around also helps Apartment Managers avoid sitting all day which isn't good for their health.

- Delivering the message of rent increases in a positive way
    - Your clients will __not__ like rent increases. How can you deliver the message in a positive way? The important part is to not come off as greedy. It's best to blame external factors such as tax increases (that residents likely voted for and saying you are happy they are supporting the community), increased building expenses (show that you are maintaining the building and their quality of life), increased wages for building staff (it's hard for your residents to complain to the staff that they don't want them to paid more, since then they are the greedy ones) etc... It's very important you (as the building owner), do not come off as greedy. The more transparent and honest you can be with your residents, for example if you can show them the actual building expenses, the better off you will be. Ultimately as a building owner your goal is a steady return on your investment, you don't need to make more, since this easily has residents conclude you are taking advantage of them (which you possibly are). If you consistently raise rent by the same small amount each year, most residents won't object too much. Make sure to give residents multiple months of notice before raising rent (preferably six months, and make sure to remind them again the month before the increased rent is due).

- Parties
    - A summer party can be a nice touch for residents. Parties can take some amount of work to organize and staff, make sure your Building Manager and residents are enthusiastic about the idea.

- Reoccurring Activities
    - If your apartment manager has a personal neutral hobby they want to share or teach to residents (Yoga, Crafts, Board Games, etc..), allow them to set up a consistent time that's available to residents. This helps your Apartment Manager have more fun on the job and allows residents to connect and build a consistent relationship with your apartment manager. Having friends in the building makes it less likely people will move out.

- Quiet Hours
    - Sleep deprived residents are grumpy residents. Make sure quite hours are posted, enforced, and address noise complaints promptly. Neighbors that know each other are more likely to resolve noise complaints on their own without having to involve your apartment manager. I recommend placing quiet hours on a visible sign on each floor, just when residents exit the elevator, or when they exit the stairs, with an appeal to respect their fellow neighbors.
