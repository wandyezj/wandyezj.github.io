# Programming Lab Tips

- Provide any text you want students to output exactly so it can be copied into their program.
    - Don't make students manually write text from a picture, this isn't a good use of their time.

- If asking students to predict a value, make sure there is an equivalent step to check that their prediction is correct.
    - I found in an exercise on predicting simple expression outputs in Python there was a section to predict both resulting type and value. There was a check for the actual value, but not for the actual type. It's important to provide the check or students can walk away without correcting their prediction.

- Follow up any exercises that ask students for predictions by providing better rules for future predictions.
