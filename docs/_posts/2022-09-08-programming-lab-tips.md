# Programming Lab Tips

- Provide any text you want students to output exactly so it can be copied into their program.
    - Don't make students manually write text from a picture, this isn't a good use of their time.

- Provide any starting code you want students to play with in program files.
    - Do not make students copy this code into separate files.

- Code Samples in markdown files should be between code blocks ` ``` ` do not use `>` blocks for code.

- If asking students to predict a value, make sure there is an equivalent step to check that their prediction is correct.
    - I found in an exercise on predicting simple expression outputs in Python there was a section to predict both resulting type and value. There was a check for the actual value, but not for the actual type. It's important to provide the check or students can walk away without correcting their prediction.

- Follow up any exercises that ask students for predictions by providing better rules for future predictions.

- If using Markdown avoid adding HTML tags to the markdown as not all markdown readers render it properly.
    - Instead of color apply bold and italic to draw attention.

- Do Not use the term `Whole Number`
    - [Whole Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_number)is ambiguous.
    - Instead use the term Natural number or Integer depending on which you mean.
