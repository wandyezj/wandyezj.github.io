A collection of legal [cases](#cases), [laws](#laws), and [theory](#theory) related to software.

## Cases

### [Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc. (2021)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC_v._Oracle_America,_Inc.)

> "The fact that Android is free of charge does not make Google's use of the Java API packages noncommercial".

> the Supreme Court ruled in a 6–2 decision that Google's use of the Java APIs fell within the four factors of fair use, bypassing the question on the copyrightability of the APIs.

### [Microsoft Corp. v. Commission (2007)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Corp._v._Commission)

Microsoft EU Browser Choice

Microsoft violated settlement due to a genuine lack of test coverage and was fined ~$700 Million.

> The automatic nature of the BrowserChoice.eu feature was dropped in Windows 7 Service Pack 1 in February 2011 and remained absent for 14 months despite Microsoft reporting that it was still present, subsequently described by Microsoft as a "technical error". As a result, in March 2013 the European Commission fined Microsoft €561 million to deter companies from reneging on settlement promises.
