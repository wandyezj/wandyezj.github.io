I think it's beneficial at the end of a class for students to apply what they learn to something they care about, or further explore something they find interesting.

One way to do this is to have students explore on their own with a student led project.

A student led project should be done over a minimum of 3 weeks.

## Outline

The project should consist of the following parts:

1. [Plan](#plan)
1. [Do](#do)
1. [Share](#share)

Overlap of project tasks

Do    :   --
Share :    --
```

### Plan

This should take about 2 weeks.

This should be done before the projects three weeks starts.

Come up with a few different project ideas.

- Write up project ideas as a 1 sentence goal.
- Add additional clarifying sentences.

Agree on one project idea with your teacher. Your teacher should make sure it is something reasonable that can be accomplished in the time available.

Write up a more detailed plan break the project into more specific tasks and estimate the time each will take.

Have your teacher review the more detailed plan and provide comments.

### Do

This should take about two weeks.

Carry out the plan.

### Share

This should take about one week.

Present what you did to the class. Ideally though a 5 minute video.

Alternatives:

- 10 minute presentation
- paper

The goal of the presentation is to explain what you did so everyone can learn from your experience.
