I think it's beneficial at the end of a class for students to apply what they learn to something they care about.

One way to do this is to have students explore on their own.

A student project should be done over 3 weeks minimum.

The project should consist of the following parts:

1. [Plan](#plan)
1. [Do](#do)
1. [Share](#share)

Overlap of project tasks

## Plan

This should be done before the 3 weeks for the project starts. This should take about 2 weeks.

Come up with a few different project ideas.

Write up these ideas as 3 sentence paragraphs.

Agree on a project idea with your teacher. Your teacher should make sure it is something reasonable that can be accomplished in the time available.

Write up a more detailed pl

## Do

This should take up about two weeks.

Carry out the plan.

## Share

This should take about a week of preparation.

Present what you did to the class. Ideally though a 5 minute video.

Alternatives:

- 10 minute presentation
- paper
