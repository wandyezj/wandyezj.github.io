Many companies have summer intern programs as part of recruitment.

An _intern cohort_ provides interns a way to connect with: each other, employees outside of their team, and the surrounding community.

An _intern cohort_ is made up of a group interns and at least two _intern cohort leaders_ who are company employees. A good cohort size is 10-20 interns and two leaders.

Ideally at the end of the summer interns: make lifelong friends, better understand company culture, and have awesome memories to share.

## Role of the cohort leader

Cohort leaders are company employees.

Cohort leaders represent company culture. Even outside of the workplace, when interacting with interns, cohort leaders __must__ model company values and maintain workplace appropriate behavior.

Cohort leaders arrange activities outside of work to bring interns together in an informal setting to get to know each other and have fun!

## Activities

Generally, activities should encourage interns to: be social, come at no cost to interns or leaders, and be easily accessible via public transportation.
