What criteria should be used to assess interns to make a reasonable hire / no-hire decision? It's important that these criteria are determined and communicated to the intern at the start of the internship so interns have a shot at a fairer evaluation.

Many interns can be shaped to be effective employees. The question is: how much effort does it take to shape them, and is it worth it?

## Intern Evaluation Criteria

- Drive
    - Focus - Keeps goals in focus without getting distracted. Communicates any distractions, gets back on track, and finds ways to avoid repeated distractions.
    - Completes Work - Gets a reasonable amount of work done. _note_ this should be well defined at the start of the internship.
- Learns
    - Does the intern take learning seriously and continuously drive to improve their knowledge and skill?
- Engagement
    - Is the intern excited about the team and the work?
    - will the intern work hard?
    - self managed _note_ does the intern have a daily task list?
- Collaborative
    - The intern works well with others.
    - the intern explains things well to others.
    - The intern communicates daily with mentor.
- Maturity
    - Feedback
        - Asks for feedback

    - Responsible
        - Company employees are representatives of the company both inside and outside of the workplace. Actions outside of the workplace by company employees often reflect on the company.

        - no HR incidents.

        - attention to detail
        - design / architecture

    - Problem Solving

## Mentor Evaluation

The mentor should similarly be evaluated by the intern.

- Communication
    - How well did the mentor communicate?
    - Did the mentor provide clear actionable feedback on how to improve?
- Preparation
    - Was the mentor reasonably prepared from the first day?
- Support
    - Did the mentor provide a reasonable level support?
    - Did the mentor meet weekly with the intern?
    - Was the mentor generally available and open to answering questions?
