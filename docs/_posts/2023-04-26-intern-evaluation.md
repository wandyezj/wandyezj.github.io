Many companies have internship programs. These programs serve as a way to recruit college students, assess their fit for the organization, provide one-off funding for specific projects, and increase company reputation.

## Internship Program Goals

Internship programs typically have the following goals.

- Deliver a reasonable hire / no-hire decision for the specific intern.
- Make progress on a specific project with the addition of another temporary person.
- Increase company reputation as a great company and great place to work.
    - Intern has a great experience and wants to come back and they can tell others about their awesome experience.
    - Intern believes they were treated fairly.
    - Intern feels well supported.
    - Intern does fun relevant work.

## Arc

An internship is usually around 12 weeks long.

The first week should establish expectations and evaluation criteria. The intern should receive feedback throughout on how well they are doing, and what they need to change. Generally the first week should be spent getting everything set up and completing a simple warm up exercise that demonstrates everything is working.

The middle week should have an evaluation of progress on that evaluation criteria,

The final week should have a final evaluation of that criteria.

## Evaluation

What criteria should be used to assess interns to make a reasonable hire / no-hire decision? It's important that these criteria are determined at the start of the internship

Many interns can be shaped to be effective employees. The question is how much effort does it take to shape them, and is it worth it?

Criteria:

- Drive
    - Focus - Keeps goals in focus without getting distracted. Communicate distractions, get back on track, and find ways to avoid repeated distractions.

    - Responsible
        - Company employees are representatives of the company both inside and outside of the workplace. Actions outside of the workplace by company employees are often reflected on the company.
    - Workplace appropriate behavior. _note_ appropriate behavior is highly dependent on workplace. Interns may need help understanding workplace appropriate behavior.

## Mentor Evaluation

The mentor should similarly be evaluated by the intern. 

- Communication
    - How well did the mentor communicate?
- Preparation
    - Was the mentor reasonably prepared from day 1?
- Support
    - Did the mentor provide a reasonable level support?
