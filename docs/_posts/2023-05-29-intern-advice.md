A few pieces of advice for interns.

- Write down your goals for your internship and communicate your goals so people can help you achieve them.
- Talk to everyone - learn about different areas and opportunities. People love to share their experience.
- Ask questions about anything you are curious about.
- Build a consistent daily and weekly routine. Set a consistent times start and stop work. Have a consistent sleep schedule with times to go to sleep and wake up. Don't simply go home after work - plan time to meet people and explore activities you enjoy.
- Don't work on the weekends. If you feel compelled to do something work related - spend time learning.
- Bring up any issues you encounter immediately with your mentor and manager - they are there to help!
- Have fun!

## Philosophy

Internships can serve as a bridge between school life and work life. Habits set during an internship can ease this transition. Internships are a time to assess what you want to do with your life - you can set new goals for yourself and set yourself on the path to achieve them. School goals are somewhat restricted - life goals are more open ended. Internships offer resources (time, money, and exposure to alternative perspectives) to explore.
