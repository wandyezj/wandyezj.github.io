Story Games focus on players creating an entertaining story together.

## What is a Story Game?

A Story Game is a category of cooperative multiplayer games, typically for 2-5 players. A Story Games rules guide how players interact to tell a story together. A Story Games rules might help players develop a setting, craft compelling characters, prompting interesting interactions, and resolving conflicts.

Different story game help tell different kinds of stories:

- __Microscope__ focuses on telling an _epic history_
- __Kingdom__ explores _communities and how the people in them decide what they stand for_.
- __Follow__ shapes a story about characters working together to complete a quest.

## Design Philosophy

What design goals should Story Games adhere to?

- [One Shot](#one-shot)
- [Equal Narrative Control](#equal-narrative-control)
- [Simple Rules](#simple-rules)
- [Minimal Materials](#minimal-materials)
- [Exploration](#exploration)

### One Shot

By design the rules of a Story Game should be designed to allow one shot sessions.

A one shot is a game that starts and completes in a single session - typically targeting 2-4 hours.

Story Game rule books should facilitate players learning the rules and completing a compelling story in a single session.

This doesn't mean that a story game can't be extended beyond a One Short if players want to keep playing out a story, but rather a game should be able to craft a compelling story within a One Shot.

Why? Single shot games allow players to play together ad-hoc with minimal planning. This works especially well for meet-up groups where players presence changes sessions to session. Single Shot games also allow players to try different games and create new stories more frequently.

### Equal Narrative Control

By design the rules of a Story Game should give all players equal control over the narrative.

This means dividing up control of various parts of the story among players and giving them ways to resolve conflicts. Ideally the rules encourage cooperation and players to interact by building on each others ideas.

This differs from games like _Dungeons & Dragons_ or _Monsterhearts_ which have DM's or GM's - who by design have significantly more control over the narrative than other players.

Why? Giving players equal narrative control allows all players to better participate allowing a broader diversity of ideas to emerge to help craft more interesting stories. The point of Story Games is to cooperatively tell stories, not for a single person to dictate the narrative - equal narrative control by design help players better cooperate.

### Simple Rules

By design the concept and rules of a story game should be as simple as possible.

Why? Simple rules are easier to teach and for players to follow. Player should spend time telling the story verses mastering or disputing complex rules. In the One Shot scenario where time is at a premium it's particularly important that players spend as much time as possible telling the story verses dealing with the overhead of rules.

### Minimal Materials

Game rules should require a minimum amount of materials to play - ideally only a single Rule Book, Pens / Pencils, Blank Paper / Note Cards, and Standard Dice.

Why? Keeping track of different materials for different games is annoying and this reduces the barrier to play.

### Exploration

Fundamentally a Story Game should strive to be about more than having fun. Games can allow us to explore challenging ideas, teach us about the human condition, expand how we think, connect us to others, and enrich our lives.

Why? Why not?
