I've played Story Games for a long time and have often wondered, what makes a "Story Game" a "Story Game"? This essay explores my definition of "Story Game" and design principals.

## What is a Story Game?

Story Games are a category of storytelling game [^storytelling-game-wikipedia], typically for 2-5 players. Game rules guide how players interact to tell a story, for example, by helping players develop a setting, craft compelling characters, and resolve conflicts.

How do I separate __Story Games__ from other storytelling games?

- A focus on cooperative story telling where games rules give all players equal narrative control.
- A player’s ability to affect what happens in the game is not dependent on a their character’s fictional ability to do those things. [^arsludi-defining-story-games]

Different Story Games facilitate different kinds of stories:

- __Microscope__ focuses on telling an _epic history_.
- __Kingdom__ explores _communities and how the people in them decide what they stand for_.
- __Follow__ shapes a story about characters working together to complete a quest.

## Design Philosophy

What design principles should Story Games adhere to?

As a baseline all games should be safe and fun. To adhere to my definition of Story Game the game must adhere to equal narrative control. The rest of the design principals help ease play.

- [Safe](#safe)
- [Fun](#fun)
- [Equal Narrative Control](#equal-narrative-control)
- [One-Shot](#one-shot)
- [Simple Rules](#simple-rules)
- [Minimal Materials](#minimal-materials)
- [Exploration](#exploration)

### Safe

A Story Game should be safe for players. Players should feel safe to express themselves and explore stories together.



### Fun

Players should have fun, whatever that means to them. Players should walk away every time thinking "that was awesome, let's play again!".

Story Games _are_ games! A Story Game should engage it's players.

There are many ways a Story Game can be fun:

- Play with friends
- Appreciate others cool ideas
- Explore new viewpoints
- Create compelling emotional drama

### Equal Narrative Control

A story game should give all players equal control over the narrative.

This means dividing control of parts of the story among players and giving them ways to resolve conflicts. Ideally, the rules encourage players to interact by building on each others' ideas.

This differs from games like _Dungeons & Dragons_ or _Monsterhearts_ which have DM's or GM's - who have significantly more control over the narrative than other players.

Giving players equal narrative control allows a broader diversity of ideas to emerge, leading to more interesting stories. The point of Story Games is to cooperatively tell stories, not for a single person to dictate the narrative.

### One-Shot

A Story Game should facilitate one-shot sessions that allow players to learn the game rules and complete a compelling story within four hours.

One-shot games allow players to play together with minimal planning. This works especially well for meet-up groups where players may not be present every session. One-shot games allow players to try different games and create new stories more frequently. There is variability in the quality of a story from the combination of setup, player combination, and specific game. More chances at more stories keeps players engaged and coming back for more.

A compelling game session can often be extended beyond a one-shot if players want to keep playing out a story.

### Simple Rules

The concept and rules of a story game should be as simple as possible.

Simple rules are easier to teach and follow. Players should spend time telling the story verses mastering or disputing complex rules. In the one-shot scenario, where time is at a premium, it's particularly important that players spend as much time as possible telling the story verses dealing with the overhead of rules.

A Story Games rule book should be written to help players get playing quickly, and minimize rule lookup time during play. Even if a game has simple concept and simple rules - the explanation of those rules matters. Spending time on rules takes away from play time, maximize play time!

### Minimal Materials

Game play should only require commonly available materials to reduce the barrier to play. Using minimal material also helps games transition to online play [^story-games-online].

For in person play:

- One copy of the rules
- Pens / Pencils
- Blank Paper / Note Cards
- Standard Dice

For online play:

- One copy of the rules
- Video chat client
- Shared text document
- Online dice roller

### Exploration

A Story Game should strive to be about more than having fun. Games allow us to explore challenging ideas, learn about the human condition, connect us to others, and enrich our lives.
