Story Games focus on players creating an entertaining story together.

## What is a Story Game?

Story Games are a category of cooperative multiplayer games, typically for 2-5 players. Game rules guide how players interact to tell a story, for example, by helping players develop a setting, craft compelling characters, and resolve conflicts.

Different Story Games facilitate different kinds of stories:

- __Microscope__ focuses on telling an _epic history_.
- __Kingdom__ explores _communities and how the people in them decide what they stand for_.
- __Follow__ shapes a story about characters working together to complete a quest.

### One-Shot

A Story Game should allow one-shot sessions.

A one-shot is a game that starts and completes in a single session.

A story game rule book should allow players to learn the rules and complete a compelling story within 2-4 hours.

One-shot games allow players to play together with minimal planning. This works especially well for meet-up groups where players may not be present every session. One-shot games also allow players to try different games and create new stories more frequently.

A game session can usually be extended beyond a one-shot if players want to keep playing out a story.

### Equal Narrative Control

A story game should give all players equal control over the narrative.

This means dividing control of parts of the story among players and giving them ways to resolve conflicts. Ideally, the rules encourage players to interact by building on each others' ideas.

This differs from games like _Dungeons & Dragons_ or _Monsterhearts_ which have DM's or GM's - who have significantly more control over the narrative than other players.

Giving players equal narrative control allows a broader diversity of ideas to emerge, leading to more interesting stories. The point of Story Games is to cooperatively tell stories, not for a single person to dictate the narrative.

### Simple Rules

The concept and rules of a story game should be as simple as possible.

Simple rules are easier to teach and follow. Players should spend time telling the story verses mastering or disputing complex rules. In the one-shot scenario, where time is at a premium, it's particularly important that players spend as much time as possible telling the story verses dealing with the overhead of rules.

### Minimal Materials

Game play should only require commonly available materials to reduce the barrier to play:

- One copy of the rules
- Pens / Pencils
- Blank Paper / Note Cards
- Standard Dice

### Exploration

A Story Game should strive to be about more than having fun. Games allow us to explore challenging ideas, learn about the human condition, connect us to others, and enrich our lives.
