Many role playing games have been developed that contain excellent ideas, yet are challenging to play as story games.

Often these games are adapted by players from experience to make them more suitable for their play. Sometimes players are shocked to learn the way they learned to play is different from the actual written rules.

Changes often include simplifying rules, clarifying rule wording, and adding elements invented since the game was originally written.

I often think it would be neat to distribute these adopted versions so more people can enjoy the brilliance of the core game concepts.

Yet, distributing a new version of a game comes with challenges. What principals should be followed when creating and distributing an adopted version?

## Credit

Credit the original author and original work up front. One way to do this is by using the title of the original game and adding "Adoption" to the end. Make sure to visibly include the original game title and author.

Credit the person who wrote up the adoption.

Credit people who helped develop the adoption.

## Concept

Explain the core concept of the original game and how that has been preserved in the adoption.

## Changes

The goal of adoption is to supplement the original game text. The original game text should still be valuable.

Changes should focus on simplifying or better explaining rules. Care should be taken to avoid copying the original text. If the original text is copied, it should be quoted to indicate its origin.

## Open

The adoption should be open source.

Adoptions are the work of fans who love the game and want others to also enjoy the game.
