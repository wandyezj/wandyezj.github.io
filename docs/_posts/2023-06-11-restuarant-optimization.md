Running a restaurant is a challenge. The following are practices I've observed.

Generally the goal of practices is to balance enhancing the customer experience while reducing cost.

## self serve water

Allow customers to serve themselves water. This allows waiters to spend time on other tasks.

- Place a refillable bottle of water and glasses on the table and allow people to serve themselves water.
    - The waiter still has to change out the bottle at the table.

- Place cups and a refillable water cooler or tap so customers can refill their cups.
    - This requires customers to get up and move around the restaurant to refill their glasses.
    - This can create a bottleneck at the cooler if the restaurant is busy and the tap does not fill a glass quickly.
    - Water coolers can run out, and can take a while to refill. A tap never runs out, but requires more effort to install.

- Place bottles of water and glasses at a station. Allow customers to pick up glasses and bottles for their table.
    - Customers move around less than with a water cooler.
    - There is no bottleneck at the water station since multiple customers can easily pick up bottles.
    - Waiters need to refill bottles at the station.

## Self serve bussing

Allow customers to clear their dishes from the table. This minimizes time waiters spend bussing tables and clearing dishes.

- Customers need to clear their own dishes.
- This requires customers to move around with dirty dishes.
- This concentrates dirty dishes at one location so waiters only have to take in one bin.
- Dish bins needs to be emptied before they get too full.
- Trash or compost need to be emptied regularly.


## Self serve silverware

Provide silverware as needed. Minimize time spent providing silverware.

- Provide silverware with the dish.
    - Requires the kitchen or waiter provide the silverware.

- Provide a silverware station for customers to retrieve any silverware they need.
    - Minimizes asking for silverware.
    - Requires refilling the station
    - Silverware should be sorted in the kitchen to avoid clashing metal song.

## Bathrooms

- Clearly mark where the bathroom is so it's location is obvious. Use large lettering or symbols to mark the bathroom.
    - Reduce the time staff spend asking where the bathroom is.
- Hooks on the door for customers to hang their coat.
- Clean bathroom scent.
- Skip gendered bathrooms when there are individual stalls. This reduces customers wait time.
- Separate employee only bathroom. This reduces time your staff need to wait to use the bathroom, and make the experience nicer to staff. Reserving a bathroom for staff takes one away from customers. When staff use a the same customer bathroom it helps them better empathize with the customer experience.
- Provide hygiene products in the bathroom - your customers will appreciate it since it shows attention to detail.
