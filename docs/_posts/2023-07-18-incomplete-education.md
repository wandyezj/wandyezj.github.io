We often consider 'education' to be confined to the formal education we receive in school.

Yet, there is always more to know.

School provides a structure to approach learning, a jumping off point to learn on our own.

Formal education does not provide us with all the specific skills and knowledge we need throughout our lives - such a task is likely impossible.

We are lucky if we know enough to reach reasonable decisions in our complex world.

Our education is always incomplete, rarely do we know all we could.

Even if our education is incomplete we can steadily fill in gaps. We can take charge of our own learning. We can ask questions. We can learn from others. We can critically evaluate approaches. We can reflect on our own experience.
