One of my hobbies is each year making New Year cards and sending them to family and friends.

Cards are a fun way to keep in touch as friends and family move around.

Originally I made each card by hand. I would do some calligraphy, use colored pencil, and write a poem or note that entertained me - and hopefully the recipient. Each card would typically take an hour or two to create over a few days depending on the techniques I choose to apply.

Over the years I've accumulated a longer list of people I'd like to send cards to. At this point the list is too long to create a completely individual card for each recipient without exhausting myself.

I've been looking for ways to improve the experience of the cards while keeping it entertaining for myself.

I no longer hand illustrate New Years cards, instead I create a single card and print multiple copies at FedEX.

The card consists of:

- Photo
    - The photo is a favorite of all those that were taken during the year.
- Poem
    - A thematic poem - usually a Haiku.
- Drawings
    - One or two black pen sketches on a white background scanned in to add to the letter and card.
- Letter
    - An update letter about anything amusing that happened in the last year - the goal is to get a laugh. I print this in black and white.

Creating the card contents usually takes a few days. The most time consuming piece is the letter. Creating a short one page letter that both updates the recipient and hopefully gets at least one laugh is tricky. I usually go through several drafts and play with it over several days to get the wording optimized for laughs - hopefully.

There are several logistical pieces to getting the cards out:

- Getting fun stamps from USPS
- Formatting the card for printing once you have all the contents
- Sending the print to FedEx and picking it up
    - Make sure to check the entire print job in the store before accepting it. I've caught multiple defects that were luckily fixed at the store.
- Keeping Track of Contact information and Addresses for all recipients
    - I use an [Excel sheet](#tracking-excel-sheet) to track everyone's name and address.

## Tracking Excel Sheet

Keep track of everyone you want to send a card to. You don't want to accidentally miss anyone. It's far easier to have a checklist.

Have a way to contact people so you can ask if their addresses have changed.
The rule is one card per address.

Columns

- Relation: Parent, Sibling, Grandparent Aunt, Cousin, Family, Friend, Work, Neighbor
- Relation Details:
- People: The people at the address.
- Social: Contact on Social Media
- Phone: Contact Phone Number
- Email: Contact Email
- Check Address: If the address should be checked.
- To: The to line on the card
- Sent YYYY: Track if previously sent a card (one per year)
- Address Name
- Address Line 1
- Address Line 2

## Letter

- One page maximum.
- Break into short paragraphs. A paragraph should have a maximum of 5 sentences.
- At least 14 point font.

- Design for fold
    - Design the letter for folding
    - fold long ways then short ways with white on the outside
    - 60 lb paper (100 lb paper is too thick for the fold to look good)
- Adequate margin on print jobs
    - Make sure to leave plenty of margin on the print jobs.
    - Add a simple border to frame the letter

## Sender Address

The sender address in the upper left hand corner is the same on every card.

Instead of writing this out every time get a stamp.

## Pieces to optimize

- Writing out from and to Addresses
    - Currently I hand write all the addresses - this give the cards a certain charm, but it's error prone and cramps my hand.
    - Possible Improvements:
        - Get a stamp for the sender address
        - Print out Avery Labels for the to addresses pulling from the Excel Spreadsheet (would this be classy?)
        - Fountain or Felt Tip pen (something that doesn't require pressing down)
- Circle Embosser with art for the closing flap of the envelope
- Optimize fitting the letter into card envelope
    - The 8.25 x 12 paper does not easily fold into the 5 x 7 envelopes I typically use for the cards.
- Customize
    - Include original artwork that was scanned in some of the cards for those that would appreciate it.
    - Possibly leave room for a custom note.
- Tracking - Storage of all card material in a single digital folder.
    - Addresses
    - Previous Cards per year
- QR Code is practical for linking to resources but presents an aesthetic challenge.
