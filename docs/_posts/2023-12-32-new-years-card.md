One of my hobbies is each year making New Year cards and sending them to family and friends.

Cards are a fun way to keep in touch as friends and family move around.

Originally I made each card by hand. I would do some calligraphy, use colored pencil, and write a poem or note that entertained me - and hopefully the recipient. Each card would typically take an hour or two to create over a few days depending on the techniques I choose to apply.

Over the years I've accumulated a longer list of people I'd like to send cards to. At this point the list is too long to create a completely individual card for each recipient without exhausting myself.

I've been looking for ways to improve the experience of the cards while keeping it entertaining for myself.

I no longer hand illustrate New Years cards, instead I create a single card and print multiple copies at FedEX.

The card consists of:

- Photo
    - The photo is a favorite of all those that were taken during the year.
- Poem
    - A thematic Haiku.
- Drawings
    - One or two black pen sketches on a white background scanned in to add to the letter and card.
- Letter
    - An update letter about anything amusing that happened in the last year - the goal is to get a laugh. I print this in black and white.

Creating the card contents takes a few days. The most time consuming piece is the letter. Creating a short one page letter that both updates the recipient and hopefully gets at least one laugh is tricky. I usually go through several drafts and play with it over several days to optimize the wording.

There are several logistical pieces to getting the cards out:

- Getting fun stamps from USPS
- Formatting the card for printing once you have all the contents
- Sending the print to FedEx and picking it up
    - Make sure to check the entire print job in the store before accepting it. I've caught multiple defects that were luckily fixed at the store.
- Keeping Track of Contact information and Addresses for all recipients
    - I use a [Spreadsheet](#tracking-spreadsheet) to track everyone's name and address.

## Tracking Spreadsheet

Keep track of everyone you want to send a card to. You don't want to accidentally miss anyone. It's far easier to have a checklist.

Have a way to contact people so you can ask if their addresses have changed.
The rule is one card per address.

Columns

- Relation: Parent, Sibling, Grandparent Aunt, Cousin, Family, Friend, Neighbor, Work
- Relation Details:
- People: The people at the address.
- Social: Contact on Social Media
- Phone: Contact Phone Number
- Email: Contact Email
- Check Address: If the address should be checked.
- Sent YYYY: Track if previously sent a card (one per year)
- To: The to line on the card
- Address Name
- Address Line 1
- Address Line 2
- Address Line 3

## Letter

- One page maximum.
- Break into short paragraphs. A paragraph should have a maximum of 5 sentences.
- At least 14 point font.

- Design for fold
    - Design the letter for folding
    - 32 lb paper (60 or 100 lb paper is too thick for the fold to look good)
    - Fedex supports a single fold short way, then hand fold again
    - (Manual) fold long ways then short ways with white on the outside
- Adequate margin on print jobs
    - Make sure to leave plenty of margin on the print jobs.
    - Add a simple border to frame the letter

## Sender Address

The sender address in the upper left hand corner is the same on every card.

Instead of writing this out every time get a stamp.

    - Go through address Excel sheet
    - Check addresses - send a message if necessary
    - Handwrite each of the addresses onto the envelope
    - Stamp sender address onto the envelope
    - Mark each address as `a` address in the Excel sheet
1. Apply stamps

## Pieces to optimize

- Writing out from and to Addresses
    - Currently I hand write all the addresses - this give the cards a certain charm, but it's error prone and cramps my hand.
    - Possible Improvements:
        - Get a stamp for the sender address
        - Print out Avery Labels for the to addresses pulling from the Excel Spreadsheet (would this be classy?)
        - Fountain or Felt Tip pen (something that doesn't require pressing down)
- Circle Embosser with art for the closing flap of the envelope
- Stamp with nice pattern in single color ink for envelope front.
- Optimize fitting the letter into card envelope
    - The 8.25 x 12 paper does not easily fold into the 5 x 7 envelopes I typically use for the cards.
    - Fedex can fold one of the sides so only have to fold once.
- Customize
    - Include original artwork that was scanned in some of the cards for those that would appreciate it.
    - Possibly leave room for a custom note.
    - Hand written note on nice card stock.
        - What you enjoyed doing with them this year.
        - What you are looking forward to.
- Tracking - Storage of all card material in a single digital folder.
    - Addresses
    - Previous Cards per year
- QR Code is practical for links to online resources but presents an aesthetic challenge.


## General Advice

- Make all writing easy to read.
    - Short and to the point. One page max for a letter.
    - Make it accessible.
        - Use large font. 14pt minimum.
        - Use simple wording.
- Get a stamp for your return address.


## Philosophy

I am the primary audiance for my New Years Card.

The purpose of making New Years Cards is to reflect upon the past year: reviewing photos, considering memories, telling a story.

I save a copy of every New Years Card and every years I read them again.

I am the audiance I need to satisfy. I want my cards to reflect the day to day feeling of the year.

Part of the challenge and satisfaction of New Years Cards is to reflect the years feelings to others in an aesthetically satisfying way, and honing production methods to be more efficient with higher quality each year.
