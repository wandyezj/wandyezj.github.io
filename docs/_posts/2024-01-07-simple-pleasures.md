A reflection on some of my simple pleasures.


I love curing up by my milkhouse heater. Its fan hums soothingly as it blows warm air on my cold extremities. I saw an incredibly beat up version of the heater in a restaurant and fell in love with how it looked and its simple controls. I immediately purchased a version online for $20 when I got home. I've enjoyed it ever since.

I love munching on warm muffins and sipping hot tea. The familiar ritual of preparing tea and muffins is calming. I place a measuring cup of water in the microwave and heat it for six minutes. Meanwhile, I rinse out my glass teapot, select a loose leaf tea, and measure the tea into the pots strainer. When the water boils I take it out of the microwave and pour it into the pot and set a timer. I then take some muffins out the the freezer and place them in the microwave for a minute. I wait for the timer to complete. I watch the water in the teapot change to a rich hue. Taking out the muffins from the microwave and breaking them in half releases their spicy scent. Removing the lid of pot and inhaling the aroma of the fresh brew is intoxicating. Removing the leaves from the pot, replacing the lid, pouring, hands around the hot cup. Preparing muffins and tea warms me.

I love reading books. A good books takes me on an adventure. Curled up with a heater and blanket, muffins and tea - a book allows my mind to relax and explore. Reading requires a lot of concentration and a good book captures my imagination and leaves me with a new perspective.

I love looking out onto a garden view. While reading my eyes can get tired, or sometimes I need to ponder what I've read. I love being able to glance out a window into nature outside, green plants, current weather, clouds in the sky are all relaxing scenes.
