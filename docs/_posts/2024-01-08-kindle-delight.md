I love my kindle. I first got a kindle several years after seeing a friend with one. I'm a slow adopter. I thought the kindle would be a convenient way to have access to multiple books on demand, without needing a paper copy. I love paper books, but they are heavy and bulky.

Some tips to get the most out of the kindle.

Kindle, by default, is linked to Amazons kindle store. However, it's possible to load ebooks from other sources.

You can  check out digital copies of books from the library and have them show up on kindle.

It is also possible to load ebooks from other sources to the kindle device.

There are many websites on the internet that host ebooks:

- [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)
- [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/)
- [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/)

Calibre is a great tool for loading ebooks from various sources onto a Kindle device.

Calibre has a great plugin to load ebooks from multiple websites called FanFicFare.
