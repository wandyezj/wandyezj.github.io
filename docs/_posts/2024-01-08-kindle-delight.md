I love my kindle. I first got a kindle several years after seeing a friend with one. I'm a slow adopter. I thought the kindle would be a convenient way to have access to multiple books on demand, without needing a paper copy. I love paper books, but they are heavy and bulky.



One of my past times is reading original stories on the web

Some tips to get the most out of the kindle.

Kindle, by default, is linked to Amazons kindle store. However, it's possible to check out digital copies of books from the library and have them show up on kindle. Similarly it's possible to load epubs from any source to the kindle device. Calibre is a great tool for loading epubs from other sources onto a Kindle device.
