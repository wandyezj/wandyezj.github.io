Some reflections on learning the hustle [^hustle-wikipedia] [^nyt-hustle]. I'll likely expand this post with further reflections.

I've found learning the hustle to be a whole lot of fun while being a challenging mental and physical workout.

After taking several classes I am compelled to analyze the context of partner dance and the learning experience.

I began to think there are three intersecting topics, Partner Dance, Hustle, and the class itself.

## Partner Dance

Partner dances are dances where people dance with one partner at a time.

Partner dances are composed of a series of movements learned beforehand and known by both partners. Different dances have different moves.

Partner dances typically have two rolls, _Lead_ and _Follow_. These roles have corresponding moves that compose the dance.

The leads role is to direct the dance by choosing which moves to do and to communicate to the follow what moves are happening.

The follows role is to follow the lead.

### Learning Dance

#### Observe and Replicate

The key skill in learning a dance is the ability to learn moves by observing someone elses body movements and replicate those movements with your own body. This can be quite challenging when moves are composed of both upper and lower body movements and need to be timed with the beat of the music.

#### Body Coordination

Dance moves typically involve coordinating the entire body. When learning this means consciously paying attention to where your body is and adjusting it to perform the movement.

Eventually your body memorizes movements and you can focus or adjusting specific pieces.

#### Communication

Partner dance is social. A large part of dance is coordinating with your partner.

Before the dance begins this means finding and asking a partner to dance, accepting or politely refusing a dance.

During the dance this means signaling to your partner and interpreting a partners signals about what is going to happen.

## Hustle

Something that makes the Hustle unique compare to other partner dances is its "gender-neutral approach to partnering. In hustle, anyone can dance with anyone, and anybody can lead or follow"[^nyt-hustle].

Some refer to hustle as a 'Queer Dance' since lead and follow roles in hustle are not defined by sex or gender - it is expected everyone know both rolls.
