I've been thinking about relationships between people for a long time.

How people build, form, and maintain relationships between each other is the basis of all interaction.

When considering all of an individuals relationships one can think about breath and depth. Breath - the number of relationships a person has. Depth - how deep those individual relationships are.

It's difficult to lump relationships into categories, since each person and each relationship is different. Some examples: _friend_ is a broad category that includes a wide range of relationships, _partner_ appears to be a narrower category and yet also includes many different kinds of relationships.

When it comes to relationships judgement is often applied using words like _healthy_ and _unhealthy_ or _toxic_ or other words.

There are many articles and books on relationship [^atlantic-happy], with different views.
