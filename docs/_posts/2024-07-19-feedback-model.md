_"What we've got here is failure to communicate"_ - Cool Hand Luke [^communicate-quote]

Recently, during a teams meeting, I wrote a genuine compliment to a team in chat. Later, I was messaged privately that something I said could be interpreted as offensive.

I was confused - and curious.

I don't want to unintentionally offend anyone. It's important to me my writing communicates my intent.

The private message did not specify what comment was being referred to, how it might be offensive, and what action could be taken in the future to avoid the issue.

I was frustrated by my inability to act on feedback about something I deeply care about.

I began to analyze the situation. What might be a better way to give feedback? How might I better respond next time?


## Feedback Philosophy

Why give feedback?

The purpose of feedback is to change behavior. Feedback is given in reaction to an outcome, to change behavior to lead to a different future outcome.

In short, change outcomes by giving feedback to change behavior.

## Feedback Methods

Research shows, feedback works best the sooner it is given [^teaching-tips]. Give well thought out feedback, _as soon as possible_, ideally the same day.

I find the following two feedback methods are generally effective:

- Problem Solve Together (verbal)
- Request Specific Action (written)

## Problem Solve Together

Start a conversation. The goal of the conversation is to figure out what actions to take in the future.

"I'd like us to reflect on X and see if there is something we can learn to improve how we do things..."

### Common Understanding

Create a common understanding of what occurred.

"I observed..."

Start with non-judgemental observation. Get the facts. Explain what you observed. Build a common understanding of what occurred. Ask questions, have everyone explain their perspective.

### Shared Vision

Create a shared vision of better outcome.

"What outcome would be better?"

Ask questions figure out what specific outcome would have been better.

### Actions

Create actions to take to achieve the better outcome.

"What could we do next time to lead to the better outcome?."

Work together to figure out what actions to take next time.


This approach works well for ambiguous problems, can be a long conversation, but wor


## Request Specific Action

A direct method for less ambiguity. Most feedback should fall into this category.

Write out a short paragraph containing the following.

- Observation - what specific behavior or outcome was observed, describe this without bias.
- Request - What specific action?
- Context - Why take this action?
- Method - How to specifically take this action?
