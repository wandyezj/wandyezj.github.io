Why do so many software projects fail? From experience, I believe software engineers could benefit from a better understanding of risk.

This essay aims to give you tools to assess and mitigate risks of failure in your software projects.


## What is risk?

Per wikipedia[^wikipedia-risk]:

> In simple terms, risk is the possibility of something bad happening.

The key to risk is a lack of knowledge leading to uncertainty. If we have the knowledge, it's not a risk, it's a certainty.

As engineers our fundamental goal is to consistently produce the desired outcome without unforeseen consequences.

> the hard part of building systems is not building them, it’s knowing what to build - it’s in acquiring the necessary knowledge[^five-orders-of-ignorance]

To assess and mitigate risk we must reduce our uncertainty by acquiring knowledge about the system we are building.

Since we are engineers - we want to optimize! We want to assess and mitigate project failure points with minimal effort. The goal of assessing risk is to avoid putting time and energy into solutions that have a low likelihood of success.

## Common sources of risk in software projects

I see three common sources of risk to software projects: Business, People, Technical.

- Business
    - Why are we building this? Can this project sustain itself?
- People
    - Who is building this? Can people work together to deliver this project?
- Technical
    - How are we building this? Can the technical path be built and sustained given all the constraints?
