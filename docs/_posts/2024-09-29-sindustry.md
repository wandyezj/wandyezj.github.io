_Sindustries_ - industries that fulfill peoples 'sinful' desires.

## What are sinful desires?

> Each culture has its own interpretation of what it means to commit a sin. [^wikipedia-sin]

What constitutes a sin is subjective and open to interpretation.

That said:

> No society can be stable unless there is a basic core of value judgments that are unthinkably accepted by the bulk of its members [^capitalism-and-freedom]

This means that while subjective, in most societies there are some behaviors, that while potentially tolerated are seen as something society would be better minimizing.

Generally sins are considered behaviors that are considered immoral, selfish, shameful, harmful, or alienating [^wikipedia-sin]

## The Business of Sin

As with anything people desire, there are always those willing to fulfill that desire for personal gain.

In our modern society, advances in technology allow the creation of massive organizations that fulfill peoples desires at scale - including desires considered _sins_ for profit. I'll refer to these businesses as _Sindustries_.

I'll name a few legalized businesses so we can be more specific in our discussion of what industries might be considered _sindustries_.

The use of Tobacco, Alcohol, Marijuana and Gambling, are generally considered harmful for the health of individual users and those around. The effects of Tobacco[^tobacco-wikipedia], Alcohol[^alcohol-lancet] [^alcohol-medrixiv], Marijuana [^marijuana-wikipedia], and Gambling [^gambling-wikipedia] are well documented.


The incentive system for the industry is to encourage the 'sinful' behavior because it is profitable. All of these industries advertise on: packaging, billboards, TV commercials, and online ads to glamorize the behavior often with celebrity endorsement. It's an interesting contradiction, public health officials attempt to minimize the sinful behavior while industry is actively encouraging it.
