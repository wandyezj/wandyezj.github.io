Standards that would be convenient.

Communication is part of successful product use, want to make sure that people understand the risks etc...

- Electrical Panels
    - The size of the panels.
    - The mounts for switches - every company makes their own.

- Larger Electrical Outlets for ranges

- Smoke Alarm Mount
    - Why can't there be one mount that all smoke detectors use? This would make it much easier to swap out detectors. Otherwise you are stuck drilling new holes in the wall.

- Door Locks
    - Specifically the mechanism inside of doors, the size and where holes line up.

- Material Specifications for products
    - People have allergies to specific materials.
    - [Allergens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_allergens)
    - [Metal Allergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_allergy)
        - [Nickle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_allergylate)
        - Gold, Chromium, Cobalt
    - [Latex Allergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex_allergy)
    - Formaldehyde
    - Supply Chain
