This is my collection of quick tips to improve your communication in presentations. This is informed by  _How to Speak_ and _On Writing Well_.

## Structure

Presentations should consist of the following pieces:

- Introduction
    - who and what?
    - Introduce yourself
    - Introduce your topic
- Empowerment Promise
- Idea
    - Present one idea you want people to remember.
- Examples
- Show how it can be applied

## Speaking

- __Slow Down__ - draw out your words
- __Pause__ - take a breath every now and then - let people take a break to absorb what you have said.
- __Vary Pitch and Volume__ - monotone puts people to sleep
- __Express Passion__ - express your excitement about your subject - if you don't care how do you expect others to care?
- __Interact with Audience__ - this is the main advantage of a live presenter - you can respond to your audience, you can ask them questions, and get a response.

## Slides

- __First Slide__ - include title and your name, introduce yourself.
- __Remove Visual Clutter__ - logos, titles, bullets, etc...
- __Big Font__ - have only a few words per slide, assume people will read the words and stop paying attention to what you are saying.s

## Reflect

- Ask others what they took away from the presentation.
