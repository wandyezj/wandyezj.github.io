Looking back on the past shows us our journey to the present.

I believe history is worth studying to appreciate the complexity of issues and to understand the existence of and reasoning behind many of societies rules and practices.

Purpose can also be found in studying history, all aspects of humanity are on display, and it continues with every student. Where do students see themselves in the historical narrative?

I believe the history of the United States is fundamental to understanding the modern world. The lessons in US History are an excellent starting point for anyone grappling with issues of the modern world: from  civil rights, to the environment.

I believe the fundamental theme of America is freedom, this ideal has been constantly questioned and re-interpreted throughout American History. The history of the United States is one of people given the freedom to chart their destiny together.

I believe history should be engaging. Tales, where people can put themselves in the shoes of those who lived it. Objects, that can be seen, touched, or played with get a feel for the time. People, who can become role models. Questions, to challenge and form your own beliefs.

I want people to engage and grapple with the present with the knowledge of the past. I want people to be inspired by past achievements and have the ambition to top them. I want people to feel they have the freedom to believe, the freedom to choose, and the freedom to challenge quo.

I want people to relate history to their own life, and use it as a practical tool. Fundamentally I seek to ignite curiosity and passion.

All of this begins by asking questions, studying historical fact, and constructing narratives.

## Questions

- Why study history?

Throughout American History we have revisited the following questions:

- Who is a citizen?
- Who can vote?
- What is the role of government?
- What rights do people have?
- Where does each persons freedom begin and end?
- What could be better? How? What worked?
