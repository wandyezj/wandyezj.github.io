Looking back on the past shows us our journey to the present.

I believe history is worth studying to appreciate the complexity of issues and to understand the existence of and reasoning behind many of societies rules and practices.

Purpose can also be found in studying history, all aspects of humanity are on display, and it continues with every student. Where do students see themselves in the historical narrative?
