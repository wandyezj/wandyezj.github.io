Some thoughts on writing a journal.

Journal on paper, in a bound book, with fine pen, without distraction.

In the top right corner write the date yyyy-mm-dd and time HH:mm. The date and time provide context if you decide to re-read.

Take your time, write slowly. Write each letter, each word, each sentence - clearly.

Savor the all encompassing focus on a single task - writing your innermost thoughts.

Pen on paper can't be erased. You must write forward.

You must write each thought and write each sentence in sequence. No going back.

Pen and paper forces you to slow down. Crossing things out is sloppy. Think before you write.

Each entry should be a work of art - showcasing you, your thoughts, your ideas, your life, your reflection, your analysis.

Express your intent through the flexibility of pen and paper. You can form letters as you please, your can sketch, you can bold, italic, underline, change capitalization. Embrace the freedom.

Focus is bliss. Focus on your writing without distraction.
