## Directions

1. Wash and rinse the basmati rice until water turns clear. Then soak it in 2 cups of water for 20 minutes. While the rice is soaking, chop all the veggies.  Once 20 minutes are up, drain the water from the rice and set it aside.
1. Press the saute button on the Instant Pot. Once it displays hot, add oil to the pot. To the hot oil, add spice and saute for 30 seconds until the spices are fragrant.

    - potatoes
    - carrots
    - cilantro
    - garam masala
    - smoked paprika
