## Notes

tasty for a whole week

Do __not__ microwave butter to soften it, as this changes the texture of the cake, instead let better warm by leaving it out.

- can swap a half cup of flour for almond flour for a fluffier cake with a taste of almond
- add lemon zest for a more lemony flavor
- cut a cup of sugar to make it less sweet
- higher quality ingredients make a big difference especially butter and eggs
