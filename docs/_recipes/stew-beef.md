## Notes

- if you boil it a long time the potatoes and meat can dissolve into a nice mush.
- can add even more carrots and onions
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme for more flavor
- can use balsamic instead of red wine vinegar
- Add mushrooms (2 cartons) (cook first) and toss in with the meat
- Can sauté onions after the mushrooms and once caramelized can add potatoes and carrots and cook next to the stew
- is the beef broth needed? Did it with chicken broth and it was super good.
