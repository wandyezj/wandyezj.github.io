# Open Data

The idea of open data is that data is visibile to the public.

How to ensure the integrity of data sources and document how the data was collected?

How to preserve integrity of the data?

How to update the data?

How to link to the data set?

How to understand what the data represents?
    need metadata that specifies how the data was collected in as close detail as possible

How to reproduce results?

How to tell if key data was not collected?
Only have the current data, after collection difficult to collect additional data points

How to account for updates to the data? i.e. if name of a school changed? (Possible a school name is not an appropriate identifier)

How to ensure privacy for individuals in data sets?

How to trust the source of the data? How to verify that the data really came from the specific source?

How to update the data? How to pull back the data? Or mark if a set has flaws and to use a new set?

If software comes to rely on the data then there could be attempts to manipulate the data

The data needs to be accurate for any calculations on the data to have a chance of being accurate. Garbage in Garbage out.

Interesting Projects

## Examining Data on data.gov

Complicated by lack of concrete entities to join on. How to define a concrete entity? Lack of documentation on how data was collected. Lack of documenation on how data was aggregated. Process to collect and have additions to the data set year over year. Use of CSV over TSV
