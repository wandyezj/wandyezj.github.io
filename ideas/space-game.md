## Thoughts

Generally in space games there are two designs:

- warp points - Directed Graph
- open space - can move anywhere on a grid or in space

Warp points tend to bog down into defense of strategic areas
Open space means any area is subject to attack. It also possible to have open space with warp points or strategic locations.

One thing that is annoying is planetary defense / invasion. From a real standpoint invasion could be extremely costly especially if there were rebel factions. It's more reasonable to blockade (The planet could still be self sustaining)

- invade
- blockade
- bombard
- cleanse

getting into the nitty gritty details probably isn't super fun for players, its probably better to choose options from a list.

One question would be what is the value of capturing planets? It's far more efficient for most industry or most objectives to be in space. Thus planets would mostly be about a place for people to live. Planets would be centers of administration, research, engineering, culture, archeology etc.. As most industry could be off planet. Similarly planetary defenses would be around the planet and not on it. This would make planets that are easily habitable valuable to the population. However, different cultures might view planets and living in space differently. In some ways space would be a much more interesting place to build than on planets.


It's common in these types of games to have new of something happening somewhere come along or to have announcements such as the Galactic News Network, or announcements of wonders being built, or comparisons of different empires

Generally players compete towards a fixed set of victory conditions

In contrast games like Crusader Kings allows player to pick their own objectives.

In a story driven game it makes sense for different empires to have different short term and long term objectives instead of all competing for the same goal. Games such as Sid Meijers Alpha Centauri made each faction seem unique with different objectives even if ultimately all were competing for the same goals.

All sorts of objectives are available and can overlap

- Conquer -> But why?
- Produce Art
- Produce Wealth
- Build Wonders
- Unlock the secrets of the universe
- Explore
- Be left alone
- Have population become happy

A key piece of fun might be the role play of playing a civilization, in a wider galexy where there aer different objectives

Turn based or Time based? A key issue with both is that it's not easy to simply skip forward until something interesting happens, essentially this requires quick compute times. Frequently the AI computation is favored over the players game play, the player has to wait for AI, that's annoying. The player should be able to skip to what they find fun.

Micro and Macro management - it can be great fun to customize individual planets, but at the same time this becomes annoying when things proliferate.

It might be more interesting to have a certain number of command point that can be used for specific actions

Heroes - Every civilization needs heroes and leaders that can become legendary, part of the fun is seeing how the civilization evolves and seeing leaders and heroes perform heroic deeds.

Don't want too many heroes, heros should spawn instead of players being able to hire them, keeping heroes rare keeps them interesting and unique

Games like Crusader Kings or Dwarf Fortress really focus on the people aspect 

Building of the palace in Civilization III visible reward for progress

Civilization III -> we love the ruler days fireworks over cities

Spying knowing more about others or internal politics

Discover lore or history about the galaxy or empire artifacts etc...

It it possible to procedurally generate stories that are not simply templates and are unique?

Politics - worry about keeping people happy?

Dialogs too many dialogs in many games focus should be kept on player objectives the game shouldn't interrupt - flavor text should be flavor

Meaningful unit designs - It more interesting when unit composition and deployment can have impact on the empire



Meaningful research decisions, want both planned and unplanned results
