# Story Game Community

What defines a community?

What holds a community together?

Shared: beliefs, values, traditions, interpersonal connections

What challenges a community?

A community is fundamentally challenged by threats to what binds them together. A community would be completely stable without some sort of change. So what change would threaten what holds the community together?

How does the community respond to those threats?

What are the consequences on the community of those decisions?

In some cases the change might be so overwhelming the community falls apart.

What ties characters together?

What ties the characters to the community?

Role - characters have a role in the community where it is their everything.
Each other - characters are bound to each other


Communities can last a long time, when restarting the game have to refresh the characters and their relationships along with the current change to the community. Should check in with other players to see how they are doing.
