# Timelines

It would be cool to have a timeline of all world events. Create a generic architecture for timeline creation and viewing.

Event

- point in time
- duration - begin, and end
- location - special tag since it requires a complex description, could be area, point etc...
- tags - help filter events examples: significance



Features

- navigation through timeline
- break into individual timelines based on tags
- download JSON of the timeline (really the set of events) + structure of the events how they are displayed


## Technical

- website so freely available
- use canvas because can use it to see images
- no server
