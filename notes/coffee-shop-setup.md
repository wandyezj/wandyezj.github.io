## Design

Have bar stools on one side so people can talk to the barista,
while also having an order place, this allows performative art of making the drink as well as allowing the barista to make conversation with customers who desire it.

Have single tables, tables with two chairs, four chairs and larger so different size groups can meet up

Have quiet room people can use for studying or events.

Allow to go orders from an outside window? Probably not since it doesn't draw people inside for the richer experience? Also it leaks the temperature controls?

Want an oven with glass door that faces customers so they can see what is in the oven and a stove top with hood so things can be made.

Refrigerator for cool ingredients like milk.

Can premake salads and serve

need dishwasher.



## Draw

Events are a way to draw customers into the shop, should have 1 new event each week around the same time, and a set of consistent events so people can become regulars.

## Hours

What hours should the shop have?

Would a coffee shop that stays open 24 hours work out well?

Probably want at least two staff present at all times.

Staying open early or late might be worth it if there are people who would like a place to chill out at all hours.

Need to have enough sales each hour to at minimum pay the variable cost of staying open.

Want staff people to overlap each other to people get to interact with different people and learn from different people

example if each x,o,s,l,h is an different persons hours, this allows people to overlap and work with different people.

lllloooooooohhhhhhhh

It may be difficult to get people signed up for consistent long shifts so in that case could fill in with shorter shifts during buy times. Ideally would have a manager who is in charge of everyone and there most of the time.

## Metrics

For each item sold track, type time, value, tip, specific credit card number used.

Keep this data for all time if legally allowed to track seasonal shifts.

Track how often customers become repeat customers, track inflow and outflow of new customers.

Project future revenue.

Track every single item purchased, and any wastage of items to determine where to save.

## Equipment

- espresso machine
- large refrigerator
- under counter refrigerator
- dishwasher
- oven
- hood
- electric induction stove or small pads
- ceramic cups
- teapots

## Convenience

- what if there were very few prices on the menu? One price for a drink? Or would high low work better? A sparse menu with few prices? Or is it better to work people up with a low price thing and charge for additions?
