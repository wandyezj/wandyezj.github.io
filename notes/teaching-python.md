# Teaching Programming

Results of different operators on different types.

## Types

Check types using the `type` function.

```python
type(1) #<class 'int'>
type('1') #<class 'str'>
type(1.0) #<class 'float'>
```

## Operations with Operators

Operations between types can result in different types.

```python

# three types
# each pair of types (3 * 3 = 9 combinations)
# each operator + - * / // % **
# value and type of that value
# predict the result then try it out
# Operator order

# which operators are commutative?


```
