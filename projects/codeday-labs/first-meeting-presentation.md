### I'll go first

Hi! I'm Joe, your mentor this summer,

I've been writing software for a little bit, I still enjoy it!

I'm super excited to see what you build this summer!

### Who is next?

(3 minutes each)

### Chat a bit

Ask each question one at a time, give everyone a chance to think and write down their response.

- What do you do for fun? (besides program :P)
- What do you hope to take away from this experience?
- What is important about this experience for you?

### My Answers

I like to get coffee, work on my blog, and volunteer.

What I'm hoping to take away are fun memories of helping y'all grow and seeing what you build.

What's most important for me is that y'all have fun.

## Project Overview

(10 minutes)

### Philosophy

To me this experience is about learning together and working together to build something cool.

### Expectations

#### What I expect from you

I expect you to get to know each other.

I expect you to work together, learn together, and help each other.

I expect you to produce a video of what you have built.

I expect you to let me know if something isn't working or if there is something I can do better.

#### What you can expect from me

You can expect me to be available a few hours a week to chat over Teams. Generally, weekday morning around 8:00 PST, and some time on weekends. We will set up some time each week to meet as a team. You can always set up some time to meet 1:1 to discuss anything you like.

You can expect me to answer questions you post on Teams. I highly encourage you to ask questions.

You can expect me to provide guidance on technical choices.

You can expect me to review code.

You can expect me to occasionally contribute code.

### Timeline

Seven weeks will go by faster than you expect! It's important that we move quickly. This is a rough outline of what we will be doing each week.

- Week 1: Introductions, Project Outline, Research, Planning
- Week 2: Prototype
- Week 3: Build
- Week 4: Build
- Week 5: Polish

- Week 7: Presentation

### Coordination

We will use Teams for all communication.

- [Team Meeting](#team-meeting)
- [Individual Weekly Writeup](#individual-weekly-writeup)
- [Individual Meetings](#individual-meetings)

### Team Meeting

- Once a week
- go over progress
- share learning

Let's settle on a time:

Times: 8:00 - 9:30
After: 6:00

- Demo! What is the current state?
- What's next?
- Issues?
- Learning!

## Individual Weekly Writeup

Each Monday, I expect each of you to post an individual writeup. This writeup is intended to help you plan and see your accomplishments, and to help me help you.

This writeup should take you 5-10 minutes to write.

The writeup should have the following sections:

- Done
    - What did you finish since your last writeup?
- Now
    - What are you working on now?
- Plan
    - What are you planning to work on next?
- Issues
    - Is there anything you are struggling with?
- Grow
    - What is one thing you learned last week?


## Individual Meetings

If you have questions about anything or want to go over things, I'm happy to set up a 1:1 meeting with you. :)

## Walkthrough

(10 minutes)

We're going to walk through the repository together.

- Setup
- Tools
    - GitHub
    - NPM
    - TypeScript
    - Webpack
    - Playwright

We're going to walk through the standard development loop.

- Pull Requests
- Code Review

All code checked into the repository needs to be code reviewed by at least one other person. We will go over how to do effective code review.

## Questions

- Ask me any questions you have about anything!
