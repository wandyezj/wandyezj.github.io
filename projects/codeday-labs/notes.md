# Notes

- Make sure everyone has joined the repository, pushed a branch and opened a pull request the first week.
- Go through simple development flow and making a pull request with everyone. Maybe make a youtube video or provide a link.
- Set up one on one meetings the first week, don't wait for them to reach out.
- Set up individual chats in teams.

- Teams
    - Make sure everyone uses a personal email since organizations cam apply policies that restrict messaging and calling.
    - Ask that people install teams on their phone
    - Have a backup application to video chat and make sure it's installed.
    - Give out phone number in case of needing to contact?

- worry less about automated testing given limited time frame of project
