# Notes

- Make sure everyone has joined the repository, pushed a branch and opened a pull request the first week.
- Go through simple development flow and making a pull request with everyone. Maybe make a youtube video or provide a link.
- Set up one on one meetings the first week, don't wait for them to reach out.
- Set up individual chats in teams.
