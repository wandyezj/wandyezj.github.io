# Notes

- Make sure everyone has joined the repository, pushed a branch and opened a pull request the first week.
- Go through simple development flow and making a pull request with everyone. Maybe make a youtube video or provide a link.
- Set up one on one meetings the first week, don't wait for them to reach out.
- Set up individual chats in teams.

## TypeScript Tips

- name the file the same as the main export.
- do not use `any`
- if repeating the same string turn it into a variable.
- Include TS Doc comments on important functions
- uas async and await instead of then chains see [async and await on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Promises#async_and_await)


## Teams

- Make sure everyone uses a personal email since organizations cam apply policies that restrict messaging and calling.
- Ask that people install teams on their phone
- Have a backup application to video chat and make sure it's installed.
- Give out phone number in case of needing to contact?

## Other

- worry less about automated testing given limited time frame of project
