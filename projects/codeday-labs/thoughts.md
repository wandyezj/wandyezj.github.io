## First Presentation

Make first meeting shorter, don't deep dive into code, since the first week is about understanding context.

Look into a markdown slides tool that can present a markdown file as a series of slides on a website. Black Text on White Background with headings per slide.

Create a Shared Google Doc before the meeting that contains project information. Contacts, Resources, Project Plan, etc..

Delegate someone to set up meetings after the first one?

Set aside time to set up individual 1:1 meetings with everyone.
