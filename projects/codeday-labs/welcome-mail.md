Hello All,

Welcome to Code Day labs!

I'm Joe - your mentor :)

I'm excited to have fun, learn, and build something cool with you this summer.

__About Me__

I love software, teaching, and writing on [my blog](https://wandyezj.github.io). If you are curious about my career so far you can check out [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wandyezj/). I <3 questions and I'm always happy to answer any questions you have!

__Team Logistics__

I will be using Email and Teams to communicate with everyone. I have sent you all a teams invite to your email.

I have set up a bare bones skeleton for the project on GitHub [wandyezj/rss-reader](https://github.com/wandyezj/rss-reader/blob/main/docs/about.md). I have sent an invite to your GitHub aliases. Please follow the setup instructions to get things set up and running on your machine. Send me a message on Teams if you encounter any issues!

We need to set a time for our first meeting. I propose the coming Tuesday at 8:30 AM PST, with a backup of next Saturday at 10:00 PST. Please let me know which of these times work for you.
