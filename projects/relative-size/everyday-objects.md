# Everyday Objects

Idea is to be able to get an idea of how big something is in relation to standard sized objects.

An AAA battery is a single cell that measures 10.5 mm (0.41 in) in diameter and 44.5 mm (1.75 in) in length, including the positive terminal button, which is a minimum 0.8 mm (0.031 in). The positive terminal has a maximum diameter of 3.8 mm (0.15 in); the flat negative terminal has a minimum diameter of 4.3 mm (0.17 in)

An AA cell measures 49.5–50.5 mm (1.95–1.99 in) in length, including the button terminal—and 13.7–14.5 mm (0.54–0.57 in) in diameter.[7] The positive terminal button should be a minimum 1 mm high and a maximum 5.5 mm in diameter, the flat negative terminal should be a minimum diameter of 7 mm and carry a maximum indent of 0.5 mm.[
