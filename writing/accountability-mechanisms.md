# Accountability Mechanisms

How to design systems and processes to be accountable?

Like setting a gyroscope to hold on target.

Capitalism holds its individual node businesses accountable by ensuring they maintain appropriate cash flow. When the node runs out of value or approaches negative value it shuts down.

In an Employee Employer relationship the Employee is held accountable by the Employer through the ability to terminate employment or adjust the contract.

Law precedent - accountability to the past accountability to what's written

Lawyers holding people accountable to the law via lawsuits

metrics - accountability to data, have to be careful that the metrics reflect the goal

capitalism - labor for each other

promise - Trust - know someone's actions in the future

reputation - do the things said because reputation depends on it

Getting the facts, has to be by an independent 3rd party with no stake in the conclusion other than being held accountable for the truth.

Guilt - emotions internal control

morals - personal codes of conduct where people are unwilling to compromise their personal integrity because it then requires themselves to reevaluate themselves

Compatibility - Standards if it doesn't work well with other things its a problem

The same rules that work on an interpersonal level seem to hold at a larger organizational level as well.

Maybe the way to explain is to look at specific accountability mechanisms?
