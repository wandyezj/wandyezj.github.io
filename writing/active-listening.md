# Active Listening

Up to the presenter or organizer to create and environment conducive to active listening.

- Have few points, at most three, ideally one.
- Stay on point
- Speak Slowly
- Pause
- Single topic per slide if presenting
- Emphasize the same points multiple times

Introducing people to each other, keep the number introduced to each other small. Ideally a pair at a time. Ask a random question to allow associating names with something about the person. Don't ask multiple questions it introduces too much to remember and people won't remember it anyway.

Keep people from thinking while others are presenting. Instead have everyone write down their responses at once. In an online call this can be done by having everyone write their answers into the chat and entering them at once.

- Take Advantage of multichannel communication

- Avoid meetings that could be responded to with links to a write up.
- Read any write up before a meeting so everyone has established the same context
- Get questions before a meeting starts

- People zone out from constant lecture, keep talk short and to the point.
