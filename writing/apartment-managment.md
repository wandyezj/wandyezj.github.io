# Apartment Management

The goal of apartment management is to improve the quality of the  living experience with a given budget.


- Celebrate holidays

- Holiday decorations
    - Put on a display in the lobby, the challenge is knowing your residents. It's usually safe to celebrate any major holiday where other businesses also adopt themes.
    - Christmas
    - New Years
    - Halloween
- Place themed month reminders in the elevator and the lobby. Only have a single piece fo paper with relatively few words.
- Create a schedule and checklist of when to do what on which date. It's best if these dates are relative.
- Nice, bottle of wine as a gift, a nice bottle doesn't have to be expensive but it does need to be good.

- Keep the apartment clean make sure to immediately clean anything messy, and make sure the clean weekly.
- Apartments should not smell, scents of any sort can bother different residents.
- Apartments should be quiet, make sure to remove any extraneous noises and to ban animal breeds that make lots of noise.
- Don't give gifts unless they feel premium, you don't want to give gifts that feel cheep, that comes off as potentially annoying and trying to buy favor.
- More than one elevator in case one breaks. If an elevator is out someones apartments may not be easily accessible for them.
- Online resident portal to automatically collect rent, keeps it our of sight and out of mind for residents.
- Fast internet is required for most residents
- Tastefully decorate the interior don't leave bare walls.
- Decorate the lobby and outside with an art piece by local artist this helps give the building character.
- Plats outside can help break up the building.
- Come across as being good value for money.
- Have a means of reporting issues and address them as quickly as possible.
- Interior upgrades can make the apartments seem nicer for potentially low cost over time. Consider the cost over time. The ideal time for renovations is when a tenant moves out before a new tenant has signed a lease.
- Avoid interior materials that can show wear.
- Ceiling hooks for paintings and pictures can avoid the need to patch divots in the wall when a tenant moves out.
