# Blockchain

## Challenges

- throughput
- decentralized
- size
- security
- usability
- versioning

## Thoughts

- want infinite throughput that scales with the number of clients
- needs to be designed right up front since change is hard

- base currency is only to pay validators to pay for transaction cost

- contracts on the chain allow for infinite usage
- chain needs to be small, or individual nodes only need part of the chain
- standard units, decimal spaces are hard for people to understand instead use base units
- potential for base currency to be come trapped loss of supply

- contracts allow for centralized authority

- blocks needs to be stacked exactly on top of each other, this presents competition instead of cooperation

- money laundering
    - exchange normal currency for chain currency, exchange on the chain, exchange chain currency for normal currency, no way to tell where the money came from.
- need way to validate who owns which accounts.
