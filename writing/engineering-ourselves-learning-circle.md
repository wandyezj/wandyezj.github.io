# Engineering Ourselves

We learn together

Get people into the habit of independent reading, learning, sharing and discussing

- Target low level of commitement, but allow greater levels of commitment
- Allow Request for Topics
- blurb of what was learned and source & distribute
- Meet over lunch
- Have an organized list of previous topics explored
- No required reading
- How to make it a sustaining group
- Consistently meet in the same place at the same time

- how to make it friendly for in person and remote?

- conference room is annoying
