# Gifts

Gift should be something practical the receiver will use.

Cards with a well written message.

Gifts are especially well received if it is something the receiver has been looking for.

Make sure any gifts given feel premium to the receiver.

Consumable gifts are practical especially if they are something that the person uses frequently.
