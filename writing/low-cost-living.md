Monthly Expenses verses yearly expenses
Want to show both numbers?s
Can we estimate cash flow?
Could plan out savings, is there a way to react to events like a job change?
Person would then need to control their expenses to stay within their preplanned budget.


## Living Expenses

- Housing
- Food
- Transportation
- Healthcare
- Clothing
- Essentials
- Entertainment

### Housing

- Close to work can reduce transportation costs
- Further from work might be less expensive
- Utilities
- Possibly live with roommates to reduce cost?

Aim for about 500 per month = 6000 per year

Per Month   | Per Year  | notes
---         | ---       | ---
100         | 1200      | Living with a benevolent person
300         | 3600      | Splitting with someone
500         | 6000      |
600         | 7200      | Most places start at 600
700         | 8400      |

Owning can be less than renting due to tax breaks and once the loan is paid off.

### Food

Nutritious Balanced Diet with a reasonable taste (delicious once you have become a better cook).

Basics

- Onions
- Spinach
- Kale
- Tomatoes
- Potatoes
- Beans
- Lentils
- Peppers
- Spices + Herbs +Salt
    - a little goes a long way
- Garlic
- Oatmeal
- Bananas
- Masa Flour
- Whole Wheat Flour
- Rice
- Olive Oil
- Fish

Avoid anything with butter or sugar or anything you can't pronounce on the back of the package.

What is the cost per meal?

- Home cooking

    - Specific meals, cost per meal = cost of ingredients / number of meals
    - Chili
    - Tacos
    - Guacamole
    - Sandwiches
    - Cereal
        - Gallon of milk = ~3
        - Box of cereal = ~ < 4
        - Per week = 7
        - Per Day = ~1
    - Oatmeal
    - Pancakes
    - Pasta
    - Toast
    - Fajitas
    - Fruit
    - Pizza
    - Nuts
    - Stir Fry
    - Stew
    - Soup

Would it be possible to have an app that checks the store prices of ingredients and checks how expensive it is to make the meal?

The cost per meal is a function of diet, healthier diets tend to be less expensive.

Total Meals in a year:

- 365 Breakfast
    - at 1 per meal = 365
    - at 2 per meal = 730
- 365 Lunch
    - at 4 per meal = 1460
- 365 Dinner
    - at 5 per meal = 1825

Total = 3650-4015

This can be reduced further if most food is homemade and following a healthy diet (which tastes better that processed food)

### Transportation

Recommendation live close to work and save. Transportation options and cost will be determined by how the community is designed.

Using the bus and using a car could come out to be roughly equivalent in terms on monetary expenses depending on the area. However, the bus will generally be significantly less expensive and potentially more reliable.

A car can offers significantly more freedom than a bus in terms of choosing residence and work options, although it can be a significant expense.

- Walk
    - Least expensive solution requires living close to work, not an option for many people due to  current community design
- Bike
    - Cost of a bike (lasts year) and keeping the bike in good condition
    - A high end bike is ~1000 but lasts for over 10 years so per year thats < 100
    - How much is maintenance?
        - probably < 500/year ?
- Public Transit
    - King County = 2.75 per ride
    - 2 rides per day = 12 per week = 1650 per year
    - 52 weeks/year * 33/rides/week * 2.75/ride = 1716/year
    - cost ~1716/year
- Car
    - Reliable Used Car
        - Possibly ~1000
        - Maintenance cost?
    - Insurance
        - Possibly ~800 per year or more possible ~1000
    - Gas
    - What is the cost per mile?
    - What is the cost of a new car financed on a per month basis?
        - Tesla 2020 Model 3 Standard (300 mile range) Lease 371/month = ~4452/year
        - Tesla 2020 Model Y Standard (300 mile range) Lease ~500/month = ~6000/year
        - Other Lease ~200-300/month = 2400-3600/year, x
            - depending on model ~30-50 Miles per gallon
            - ~2-3 per gallon (area dependent)
            - Oil change 20 - 70 depending on store (although you can do it yourself and save ~50) If you use synthetic Oil you can likely only do it once every 10,000 miles or about once a year
            - miles driven (depends on how far residence is from work location) assume about 15,000 miles a year or about ~60 per 5 day work week = 300 -500 gallons of gas = 1500 to 900 per year on gas or 75 to 125 per month
            - note: gas cost is highly variable on where someone lives relative to work
            - an other car is about 3300-4500/year
        - Other Used
            - Possibly Lower Miles per gallon
            - Estimate ~2000 including Gas and repairs
            - Likely have to buy the vehicle outright
            - Possible risk of break down and unexpected expense depending on the car model
            - Possibly recommend AAA membership, along with jumper cables
    - note: car pooling to work could cut the expense of car ownership in half to a third depending (however this requires dependence on others)

### Healthcare

- Really Expensive!!!
- What is the lowest cost plan?

- Possibly can get paid for by the government
- Medicaid is available if close to poverty level of 12000

- Insurance is maybe 200/400/500 month?
    - Highly dependent on the state
    - in 2020 Washington State seems to be about 340?
    - Seems to really depend on the plan
    - so maybe in the range of 2400/4800/6000

Best way to reduce Healthcare costs is to take care of your body, avoid dangerous hobbies, and avoid dangerous occupations.

### Clothing

How many outfits are required?

- Work
- Home
- Outdoors

Specific Items

- T-shirts
    - ~20 each but last several (5+) years
    - Possibly much less expensive at a thrift store ~5
- Shoes
    - Nice ones that last a year are probably around 100
- Pants
    - Jeans - last a long time and can be comfortable
    - Maybe some nice ones are 50
- Shorts
    - Can be made from old jeans by cutting and sewing the bottoms if you are fashion and cost conscious
- Undergarments
    - 20

Most items cost can be significantly reduce by buying used.

Say the total cost is ~200 if you get one reliable new outfit that lasts each year, and a new pair of shoes (although some shoes such a certain Sperry's can last multiple years)

Laundry expenses

Tide for 32 loads of wash is about 6 per bottle if you get it on discount, probably average 4 loads a week (if you really like doing laundry)

52 weeks * 3 loads/week = ~150 loads a year

150 loads / ~30 loads/bottle * 6 per bottle = ~30 for detergent

If your apartment does not have a built in laundry unit it usually costs about 2 per load (washer + dryer) of wash

150 loads * 2 per load = 300

Total cost of laundry is about <~350


### Essentials

- Phone
    - Phones are essential for almost every aspect of every day life. Coordinating with friends and family, finding Jobs, and being contacted for Jobs.cows
    What is needed on a phone?
    What model of phone?
    good around 300 to unneeded around 600 but lasts 3 years or more meaning 100 - 200 per year.
    Internet is likely somewhat required to coordinate with people and fond jobs these days
    Phone bill is likely around 40 per month meaning ~480 per year
    Case Study: iPhone is 400, however it can be financed with the Apple Card 
    - for the 2020 iPhone SE 16.62/month for 24 months = ~200/y for 2 years
    - for the 2020 iPhone 11 29.12/month  for 24 months or ~350/y for 2 years.
    - T mobile 
        - essential plan is 100/month for four lines
        - single line 70/month for the Magenta plan
        - single line 60 for essentials
    - this means that mobile internet is  ~852/y
    - A new phone is thus at a fixed cost of ~852 a year for a single line or for a family of four lines ~1200/year or single ~300/year for four lines (family) (many people share their phone plans within a family)
    - The variable cost is in the model of phone, for a new high end phone like the iPhone this is about ~200/year on top if the phone lasts two years or, ~150 if the phone lasts three years
    - This means a single phone and plan can range from about 500/year to 1152/year depending on how cost and cooperative people are.
    - note: some phone models can be turned into wifi hotspots 'tethering', thus an external laptop can be connected to the internet through a phone plan. That is a laptop could be used to do work offline to be synced later or to browse more comfortably. Would have to check what the data plan is for the phone, however most basic tasks should be doable.

- Bed - a bed can last 10+ years
    - A comfy bed is potentially bad for physical health, recommendations are a pallet (like Japan) which can be less expensive,
    - babies are especially at risk if they are kept in cushy beds with
    - Parents sleeping with their kids in the same bed has when they are younger has show significant health benefits especially to mental well being as the child grows (although it's possible intimacy between a couple can suffer if other arrangements are not made)
- Sheets - a set of sheets can last 5+ years
- Cleaning Supplies
- Cooking Equipment
    what specifically? Generally lasts a long time 10+ years
    - Instant Pot
    - Toaster
    - Pan

### Entertainment

Strive for zero cost options

-  Exercise without equipment
    - Walks
    - Free form exercise
    - Biking
- Social
    - Community Service
    - Local Government
    - Chats
    - Board Games
    - Story Games
    - Cards Games

- Library
- Writing
- Computer
    - Expensive to have home internet at ~40 per month means ~480 per year
        - Can use free computers at the library
        - Can use free wifi at a library or most cafes
        - YouTube Videos
        - Wikipedia
        - Research
    - A reasonable laptop computer is about ~400 a nice one is around 800, however the computer should last around 4+ years meaning this is a cost of about 100 to 200 per year (much less expensive than internet)
        - Multimedia art programs
        - Probably want if using public transportation

#### Expensive Entertainment

Sins of a Budget

These are entertainment options that can be very expensive


- Pets
- Smoking
- Drinking
- Junk Food
- Fashion
- Salons
- Subscriptions
- Makeup
- Restaurants
- Travel
- Kids

Comments

- Restaurants are expensive and generally serve food that is not optimal (and sometimes harmful) for physical health
- Kids are expensive, if you are trying to keep costs low to work minimal hours and pursue artistic passions, kids are not ideal. Each child costs roughly ~1000+/month = ~12,000/year. Not to mention the incredible investment in parental time.

## Case Study for Seattle


Assume minimum wage of 7.50 with a 40 hour work week and 50 weeks of work per year and 2 for vacation

7.50 * 40 * 50 = 15000 (after tax this is probably ~13500)


Note: Seattle requires a minimum wage of 15 so this is really: ~30000, although after tax this drops to about 25000

What is the tax rate?

What is income post tax?

- Housing
    - 800-1000/month ~= 7600-12000/year depending on where you live and if you have a roommate.
- Phone
    - 500-1152 hinging on how good of a relationship you have with your parents
- Transportation
    - Walk, Bike, Bus
    - 0, 100, 1716
    - Cars are not a reliable option to get to work in Seattle unless you want to be stuck in traffic
- Clothes
    - ~600/year
        - 350 Laundry
        - 200 New Clothes
        - 50 round to make math easy
- Food
    - 3650-4015/year
    - heavily dependent on diet, healthy diets tend to be less expensive
    - avoiding meat (unhealthy + gross) reduces costs
    - avoiding preprocessed food (unhealthy + gross) reduces costs
- Health Care
    - 5000/year
    - Health insurance is a mess on complication since it is highly variable based on plan choice, co-pays, deductibles, etc.. Why is it so complicated? Decided on what seems like a high amount, but maybe it isn't? Also depends if it is covered by an employer



Totals:

Low Estimate

Housing 7600
Phone 500
Transportation 0
Clothes 600
Food 3650
Health 5000

Total 17350


High Estimate

Housing 12000
Phone 1150
Transportation 1700
Clothes 600
Food 4015
Heath 5000

Total 24465


Key areas to target saving are:

Entertainment ?
Housing ~4500
Transportation ~1000
Phone ~600
Food ?

Note: housing and transit go hand in hand, it's a balance finding an optimal combination between the two

The relationship between housing and transportation is a function of where the work is, and what housing situation is in the area.

Adjusting to a healthier diet with less preprocessed, less prepackaged food, less meat, more beans, more vegetables, more fruits, more healthy homemade food is more nutritious 


## Process for Assessment

Consistent Expenses
Year, Month, Day

Consider all expenses yearly as the base value.
For expenses that span across years consider a yearly contribution via financing options (no required down payment) or over the expected lifetime of the product.

Could break it down in terms of number of hours going towards each item.

Think of all work in terms of hours and total wages produced from those hours.

Can also break each item down in terms of the number of hours required.

Show each expense in terms of:
Total Cost, hours worked for that expense per year

One Time Expenses

How should these factor in?
