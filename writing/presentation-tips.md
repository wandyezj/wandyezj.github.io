# Presentation Tips

- Use black text on a white background
    - highest contrast
    - Do NOT use white text on a light color background - much harder to read and if the presentation is in a bright room it obscures the text
- Use a BIG font size
    - easier to read
- One idea (max two ideas) per slide
- Fewer words
- Pictures for main points
- Pause and take Breaks between speach points, slides are natural breaks
- Big blocks of text distract from the speaker
