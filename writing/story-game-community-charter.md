# Story Game Community Charter

## Purpose

- Have fun! (if you aren't having fun, what's the point?)
- Expose more people of all ages and backgrounds to story games.
- Teach storytelling, empathy, and cooperation through gaming. (Higher purpose)

## Method

- Build an inclusive community that sustains itself. (I should be able to leave at some point and the community should run itself smoothly)
- Empower others to build similar communities.
- Meet up once a month on the weekend in a public library for 1-3 hours.
- teach about storytelling, empathy, and cooperation
- have fun learning and telling stories together

## Community Rules

- Respect the community, others, and yourself.
- People under 16 years old must play with their parent or guardian.

## Game Selection Criteria

Game selection criteria are about facilitating the selection of games to match with the purpose of the community. The primary purpose of the community is to include and teach new people about storytelling through story games. We want everyone to be able to equally contribute to the story being told.

- Games must allow all players to equally contribute to the story.
    - Everyone should feel equally included and able to equally contribute to the game.
- Games must deliver a full experience within one to two hours.
    - Practical constraint due to the nature of the meetup.
- Games must all be one shots.
    - Having games that last multiple sessions makes it hard for new people to join.
    - We want to encourage people to play with different people.
- Game rules must be simple enough where anyone can pick up and understand the rules within the first half hour.
    - Complex rules make it hard for people to equally play and contribute. Complex rules can potentially give an advantage to players who know the rules better.
- Games must focus on telling stories.
- Games must not allow players to be eliminated from the game.
- It is preferable if games only require pencil, paper, and six sided dice.
    - Practical concern to simplify logistics.

## Inclusive

What does inclusive mean for the community?

- Everyone feels welcome
- Everyone feels like they can participate
- Everyone feels like the can contribute

To make everyone feel welcome there needs to be a framework rules to set expectations of appropriate behavior and ways


appropriate for your group

- family friendly
- play test - separate meetup -> when to graduate
- criteria for approving games

- Approved Games

Need to have list of games

Game Criteria


What the meetup is about specifically?

What is the opinion about what story games is about

Be honest about why specifically

Honest about the reasons why motivations ok to disagree but that's not why then find a different group
For the good of the community

Rules are so everyone can equally contribute

People need to understand the rules.

- All single shot games - want to be able to pick up and play - want people to be included
- Simple Rules so can pick up and play
- Rules visible up front
- People can't be kicked out of the game
- GM less, games must allow everyone equal narrative control, the purpose is to practice story telling so games should be directed towards that goal, equal contribution, equality for players
- Games must be officially published and have been played at a (non-play test) Story Games Seattle Meetup. This meetup is not to play test games, its to teach accessible well established games. Well established games are those that are officially printed. Instructions must be simple enough where it can be picked up and played.
- Parents must play with or watch their children play the game (for the purposes anyone under High School under 16 is considered a child)

Approval process for new games -> must be played with other members and be recommended by Admin members of Story Games Seattle.

If you are thinking about a game that's not been played before please email beforehand to ask if it's a good fit for the meetup.

- The Mind of Margret: https://cluckyb.itch.io/the-mind-of-margaret

Ideal group size is 3-4, players

The Facilitator's role is to help people learn and play the game together.

- Safe Playing environment
    The X - Cross things out

- Speak up if something makes you uncomfortable when in doubt use the X
- Make sure limits are clear

Read off the Introduction have each player read a piece

Need a closed space in the library that so people do not disturb other patrons

What if people don't like someone?
Some behavior not acceptable? But it is a judgement call. Creepy, no hitting on people. Someone asks you to stop you should stop.

But what if... Someone else comes up to you and says someone  was doing something disrespectful? But sometimes people are misinterpreting things... so how to discuss?

Annoying but not bad.

Uncomfortable or annoying?

Protect the fun, solve the problem before it's trouble.
